Because full scanning needs one of the following:
1) Working alloc - not possible for SoCs
2) Hacks with wrappers, static cores info, lack of optimization (list)

Yeah, this should be quite easy.

struct bcma_device core = bcma_early_find_core(bus, CC);
bcma_cc_init(core);

Not sure about this one. You have drivers for chipcommon and mips as
part of bcma. Do you need to involve arch/mips/bcm47xx to this?

Nothing hard to handle.

Really, I've nothing against scanning and splitting init into "early"
and "late". It's going back to static fields and wrappers that I don't
like :(
