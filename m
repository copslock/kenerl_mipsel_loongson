Subject: Indy 64 or 32 bit?
Sender: owner-linux-mips@oss.sgi.com
Precedence: bulk

I will be purchasing 2 SGI Indy R5000 models from reputable.com, and was 
curious if these are 64 bit systems or 32 bit systems (for that matter, are 
all/any Indys 32 or 64 bit systems).  My guess is 64 because I wiould think 
IRIX has been 64 for quite some time, but was curious.  I use Linux on x86 
but will probably use IRIX for a few weeks on the Indy's until I become 
familiar enough with the machines to try installing Linux.  BTW, does gcc 
work on IRIX?

Thanks for the info,
Brandon Barker
