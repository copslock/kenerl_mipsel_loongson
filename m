Hi Jean,

 No need to repeat this -- it was a side note of mine already and I agreed 
with you about the visibility of a phantom device.

 Too bad for the reality it does not agree then?  While you might desire
system designers record the configuration somewhere in some software
accessible way (unless it is entirely fixed), as you can see with the
SWARM, it may not necessarily be the case and you may have to ask the
hardware directly.

 By all means it sounds reasonable and desirable, but I do not think this
an excuse for saying: "Let's not support this board, system, etc. because
the designers did not follow our way of thinking." -- I think if a piece
of hardware does not fit our model, then we should either adjust the model
or come up with a solution which makes the device work with as little
negative impact to the model as possible.

 Fortunately, as I mentioned previously, we can escape the dilemma for the 
SWARM for now.  I should come up with updated patches tonight.

 That might make sense, although in the case of a RTC chip we have some 
desire to use it before userland is run.

 Hmm, an ATX-form board like the SWARM, with SDRAM and PCI slots, IDE,
Gigabit Ethernet, USB and sound ports onboard, and keyboard and VGA
support in the firmware can hardly be called embedded. ;-)  It even comes
in a desktop enclosure with drive bays, etc.  It makes quite a nice PC
based on a decent processor architecture. :-)  The only difference making
it a bit more embedded is most of the functionality is implemented in the
SOC leaving off-chip features mainly to a bunch of I2C peripherals and
then boring stuff like line drivers and passive components. ;-)

 I agree for truly embedded systems it should not matter as I would expect
them to come in a fixed configuration.
