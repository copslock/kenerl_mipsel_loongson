Well, not everything works as planned.  While in the meantime Linux has
been ported to quite a number of new MIPS targets Linux has not yet been
ported to the machines mentioned above.  I however hope the SGI's recently
announced commitment to Linux will also have some effect on the MIPS area
and make above port come true :-)
