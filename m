One of the things on the kernel summit was the whole patch submission.
Linus put emphasis on that he wants the pull request on the first day
of the two week merge window - and that's the pull requests from us
maintainers not those who submit to us.  As the result that means that
I won't be able able to accept any feature patches for release $n + 1
once $n has been released.

So if there is anything you want to get into 2.6.24, send asap svp.

Thanks,

  Ralf
