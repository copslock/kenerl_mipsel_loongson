pcibios_scanbus() builds the &resources list of host bridge windows,
then calls pci_scan_root_bus().  If you're proposing to change the
list of host bridge windows *after* calling pci_scan_root_bus(), that
sounds a little problematic because we do not have a PCI core
interface to do that.

Do you need to allocate the big windows based on what PCI devices you
find?  If so, that is going to be a hard problem.

OK.  If you only plug in PCI devices, there should be no problem.  If
you did plug in PCIe devices (via a PCI-to-PCIe bridge, for example),
the core should still enumerate them correctly and they should be
functional, though some PCIe-only features like AER won't work.

I don't think USB hubs are relevant here because they are completely
in the USB domain.  The USB 2.0 board is a USB host controller with a
PCI interface on it.  The USB hub is on the USB side and is invisible
to the PCI core.

The way I read the BSD code, it looks like you should be able to use
the Type 1 config interface to generate accesses to any PCI bus, as
long as you serialize them, e.g., with a lock around the use of
b_type1_cfg.

If you only support PCI devices, 256 bytes of config space is enough.
The 4K config space is only supported for PCI-X Mode 2 and PCIe
devices.  Even those PCI-X Mode 2 and PCIe devices should be
functional with only 256 bytes.

I didn't word this well.  I was trying to point out things that look
like bugs in pci_conf1_write_config() (the use of b_type0_cfg_dev) and
maybe pci_conf0_read_config() (the fact that it allows 4K config space
but the hardware probably only supports 256 bytes).

These are mostly PCIe features and I don't think you should worry
about them, at least for now.

This is the problem I alluded to above: Linux does not currently
support anything like this.  We assume the Linux host bridge driver
knows the window sizes at the beginning of time (it may learn them
from firmware or it may have hard-coded knowledge of the address map).

Linux does enumerate the devices and tally up all the BAR sizes (see
pci_bus_assign_resources()), but it does not have a way to change the
host bridge windows based on how much BAR space we need.

The common thing is to use whatever host bridge windows and device BAR
values were set up by firmware.  If those are all sensible, Linux
won't change anything.

If ioremap() doesn't return a virtual address, or at least something
that can be used like a virtual address, I think that's fundamentally
broken.  All drivers assume they should ioremap() a BAR resource,
i.e., the CPU physical address that maps to a PCI BAR value, and use
the result as a virtual address.

Documentation/DMA-API-HOWTO.txt has a picture that may help clarify
the different address spaces.

If all three windows are disjoint, you can specify them all.  If a
range in the small window is aliased and can also be reached via a
medium or large window, you should not specify both.

The PCI core isn't involved much with DMA, so I don't know this off
the top of my head.

Theoretically you should not need to do any PCI device tweaking: PCI
devices are basically arch-independent and shouldn't need
arch-specific tweaks.  All the arch stuff should be encapsulated in
the host bridge driver, i.e., the code that sets up the window list
and calls pci_scan_root_bus().  In the MIPS case, this code is kind of
spread out and doesn't really look like a single "driver".

The ideal thing would be if you can set up the bridge to always use
large windows.  Then the PCI core will enumerate the devices and set
up their resources automatically.

I assume the small/medium windows exist because there's not enough
address space to always use the large windows.  I don't have any good
suggestions for that -- we don't have support for adjusting the window
sizes based on what devices we find.

You can't use pci_read_config_dword() before we scan the bus because
it requires a "struct pci_dev *", and those are created during the bus
scan.
