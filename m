I think 19kb is worth it, though I was actually more interested in the
runtime overhead.

Yes, good idea.

Ok, I see. It looks like you can have a combined kernel that runs on
BMIPS BCM47xx and MIPS32r2 74K BCM47xx already, right?

So it's not fundamentally incompatible with the other platforms?

I still think this is different in the sense that ARM multiplatform
support is about combining platforms from separate mach-* directories,
while your approach was to rewrite multiple mach-* directories into
a single new one that remains separate from the others. While this is
a great improvement, it doesn't get you any closer to having a
combined BMIPS+RALINK+JZ4740+ATH79 kernel for instance. I don't know
if such a kernel is something that anybody wants, or if it's even
technically possible.

If you wanted to do that however, starting with BMIPS you'd have
to make it possible to define a new platform without the
arch/mips/include/asm/mach-bmips/ directory (this should be possible
already, so the hardest part is done), replace all global function
calls (arch_init_irq, prom_init, get_system_type,  ...) with generic
platform-independent implementations or wrappers around per-platform
callbacks, and move the Kconfig section for CONFIG_BMIPS_MULTIPLATFORM
outside of the "System type" choice statement.
Until you do that, your platform isn't "more multipliplatform" than
the others really, it just abstracts the differences between some
SoCs nicer than most.
