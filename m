If anyone on the linux@engr list is _not_ interested in these
CVS commit auto reports, let me know and I'll ask majordomo-owner
to create a separate:

	linux-progress@engr

majordomo list.

Until we see objections/too-much-traffic, I think Dave can
go ahead and auto-mail the reports to linux@engr

Personally, I think I'll find these interesting.

Anyone?
