Too shortly answered.  It turned out that some CSP codes (like Qsound)
can be above that size, it's almost 12kB.  So the size in the original
code is really the necessary requirement, and the patch breaks for
such a case.

An ugly workaround would be to fake the ioctl size.  But this is
certainly to be avoided, since it has been broken on the specific
platforms for ages, thus breaking for them would be mostly harmless,
too.

Actually the request_firmware() was implemented for some auto-loadable
CSP codes.  Others need the manual loading, so it is via ioctl.  It
can be converted, but I don't think it makes sense for such old
stuff.  After all, it still works with x86-ISA as is.
