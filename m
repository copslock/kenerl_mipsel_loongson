Hi, 

	    Inspired by your advice , I have changed the method of preventing the module 
from being unloaded while "intrpt_routine" is still in the task queue.Now it can freely 
"insmod" and "rmmod" in my linux(2.4.18-3,not on mips) at  any time.But unfortunatlly,
When I port it to mips_linux, it get some errors as you can see in my mail to 
linux-mips@linux-mips.org . It confuses me .Why? And what should I MUST pay attention to
or what should I MUST learn if I I want to implement schedualing a function to be called
on every timer interrupt.

        Thank you again and eagering your enthusiastic again!
