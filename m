Apparently, MIPS's implementation of ioremap does not guarantee that a virtual
address is always returned.  Quoting from arch/mips/include/asm/io.h around
line #236:

/*
 * ioremap     -   map bus memory into CPU space
 * @offset:    bus address of the memory
 * @size:      size of the resource to map
 *
 * ioremap performs a platform specific sequence of operations to
 * make bus memory CPU accessible via the readb/readw/readl/writeb/
 * writew/writel functions and the other mmio helpers. The returned
 * address is not guaranteed to be usable directly as a virtual
 * address.
 */

It looks like the qla1280.c driver calls pci_ioremap_bar(), which calls
ioremap_nocache(), and on MIPS, that's just an alias (as far as I can tell) to
ioremap(), and it has the same limitation, that the address returned may not
be usable as a CPU virtual address.

This is basically the same conclusion I've come to.  I've found a "partial"
solution, but I'm pretty sure it's wrong.

It seems the reason IP30 works without PCI_PROBE_ONLY now is because it doesn't
need special casing on the addresses in order to work.  IP27, on the other
hand, needs all I/O accesses to go through the 0x92xxx range or you'll run into
hardware-enforced barriers that will panic the kernel.

First attempt I did was to simply subtract NODE_IO_BASE(_n) from the address
values that ultimately get fed to pci_add_resource_offset().  That yields this
kind of output:

Despite the above errors, it succeeds in probing and finds devices and boots
into userland.  The error message above stems from 'pci_claim_resource' in
drivers/pci/setup-res.c because it can't seem to find the parent bridge.  Not
sure if that's good or bad.  But it does boot, and it would remove one of the
two #ifdef hacks in my patch.

So I next looked at the offset bit you mentioned, and after some fiddling
around in pci-bridge.c, got this dmesg output, which matches what you say
should be the correct dmesg output:

And you can see that while the dmesg output is correct, the end result is not.
The issue goes back to what MIPS's ioremap() is doing when it encounters the
specialized cached-uncached attribute of the R1x0k CPUs on IP27, it tries
adding 0x9200000000000000, which is IP27's IO_BASE, to one of the addresses
during qla1280's probe, which wraps around to 0x240000000xxxxxxx and is
invalid in MIPS.  This leads to the unhandled kernel unaligned access panic.

I tried implementing a custom plat_ioremap() that would subtract the IO_BASE
off of the address being ioremapped by qla1280.  MIPS has a generic template
available to do this in arch/mips/include/asm/mach-generic/ioremap.h, but it
appears my gcc version is recent enough to have some new checks enabled that
choke on casting a phys_addr_t to void __iomem * (-Wint-to-pointer-cast), and
I've given up finding a workaround that doesn't involve invasive changes to
MIPS's ioremapping core.
