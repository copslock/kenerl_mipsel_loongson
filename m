But Jun Sun asked whether distribution of a binary in a ROM inside a
black box might not really count as distribution.  I don't think you
need a lawyer to resolve that.  If the software was a computer game
(for example) I can't quite see its commercial owners smiling
indulgently and saying "it's only a ROM, carry on...", and I don't see
them having trouble over their position in court.

So yes, binary code distributed in a black box is still distributed,
and if it was GPL software you are entitled to the source code.  It's
sensible of Cisco to put it quietly on a web site somewhere.
