Hi,

I just was wondering whether this option would be a thinkable way to an  X server, of course in case one would go for the LCD Flat Panel onto the Visual WS.

I mean, putting the Number Nine card in a Pci slot and then running the commercial X server off the current ported Linux.

 Thanks, Marco
