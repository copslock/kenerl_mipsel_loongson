 You'll need a `-mfix-r5900' workaround in the compiler then.  One for GAS 
for handcoded assembly might be doable as well, fixing the `reorder' mode 
only and possibly bailing out if the conditions are met in the `noreorder' 
mode.

 Still R5900-specific code may use it.

 It might be preferable to use:

	if (IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_CPU_R5900))

instead.

 There is already a `spec3_op' case in this `switch' statement, so you 
need to fold your code into it (have you actually successfully built this 
piece before posting?).

 I think `r_format' is more appropriate for RDHWR (`spec3_format' really 
matches EVA instructions only; we might invent a distinct new format for 
the BSHFL, DBSHFL and RDHWR minor opcodes, but I think this would be an 
overkill) and you need to qualify the other instruction fields, i.e. `rs' 
and `re', because of the overlap with SQ.  We only want to give the 
special exception for what looks like a real RDHWR instruction and not 
just any faulting SQ whose least significant bits of the offset happen to 
match the RDHWR minor opcode.

> +			do_ri(regs);

 Or rather `simulate_rdhwr(regs, insn.r_format.rd, insn.r_format.rt)' as 
we've already qualified it.

 This I think should be `sigbus' as the SQ opcode is valid on the R5900.
