   1. Do Indy's come equipped with floppy drives?  What are they?  Is it
   possible to boot from them?

Yes, they are SCSI floppy drives.

   2. I know O2's have PCI busses with a custom controller.  Do Indy's have
   this too? What is the name of this controller? It would seem reasonably
   easy to slap a PCI VGA card in there and port XFree86 to run on it.

No, but I believe some models were produced with EISA slots on the
motherboard.

   3. Do Indy's ship with CDROMs?

Can't answer this one personally.
