Yeah.

There's a need for high quality documentation, but I think there's a greater
need for just little status reports.  Writing good documents is *hard*, but
just little one-paragraph summaries, like a project diary, would be a
wonderful service to the community.

OTOH, although the current situation annoys me a little, it would annoy me a
lot more if upstream work on mipslinux stopped.  :-)  So please don't take
anything this list says about this as a demand.

Doesn't have to be very heavyweight to be successful.

I'll drop by soon.
