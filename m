Even if they don't its far far easier to reverse engineer the O2 working
from a stable Indy base than from a wobbly base platform. I don't personally
believe there is anything SGI could do to stop a Linux hacker making Linux
run on the O2

Yep. I don't see a big problem. Im not privy to SGI accounts but I refuse
to believe Irix itself does anything more than break even at best just by
taking published information on developer team size, and sales. In fact
I suspect its a loss maker like Solaris. If Linux sells SGI hardware Im sure it
will get us into good books 8)
