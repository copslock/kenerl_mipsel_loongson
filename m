To compile a module on mips,some compiler flags are required. An example:
  CFLAGS=
     "-I /usr/local/src/linux-mips/include/asm/gcc -D__KERNEL__ 
-I/usr/local/src/linux-mips/include
-Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -Wno-trigraphs -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer 
-fno-strict-aliasing -fno-common
 -G 0 -mno-abicalls -fno-pic -mcpu=r4600 -mips2 -Wa,--trap -pipe 
-DMODULE -mlong-calls"

And you may have know that there are 2 different world of mips: big 
endian and little endian. When
using cross compiler,you should choose the correct toolchain(often 
mipsel-xxx vs. mips-xxx).

But these normally lead to other errors, so again check for your kernel 
version about task queue data
structures. (Does your toolchain's kernel headers consistent with the 
one running on mips?)
