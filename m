Hello Carsten,

   I need help again so please forgive me if I am bothering once again. 
   What can you tell me about porting the Linux 2.4-test9 on MIPS( specially
on ATLAS ) ? Please forward this question to mips-linux mailing list because I
was in imposibility to use my usual address. 
PLease give me as much details as yopu know and as you can on porting the
Linux 2.4.0 test9 on ATLAS.

Thank you.
Best Regards,
Nicu
