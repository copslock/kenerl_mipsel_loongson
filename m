I must admit I don't completely understand what this patch is about,
other than it will most probably break the way we do resource management
on powerpc :-)

I don't understand the point about conflicts in scan_slot and I don't
see what you win by "settling down early". Also keep in mind that the
resources read from the device need to be remapped on some archs like
powerpc which we do from a header quirk at the moment.

We also have very different behaviour depending on the platform that we
can trigger ranging from ignoring all resources read from the devices
because we want the kernel to fully re-assign everything, to on the
contrary only every using what the firmware set (no re-assigning
possible), with variants such as re-assigning everything using a custom
algorithm etc....

We do rely in various places on the concept of scan first, alloc/fixup
next, then use. Merging scan & alloc/fixup of resources in one pass is a
major conceptual change. It might be ok but I need to convince myself it
is by understanding better what's going on and what problem you are
really trying to solve here.

Cheers,
Ben.
