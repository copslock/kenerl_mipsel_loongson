So what you have is actually a SGI machine.  I don't know if this machine
has been modified from the original Silicon Graphics box, so I cc this to
linux@engr in the hope someone can comment on this.

Well, I would take them, though probably not all of them because I'm
already stockpiling MIPS boxes ...

Choose between IRIX and IRIX.  Someone else is working on a Linux port to
the Indigo.  No results yet, he has just started some days ago.  Since
you're interested in Linux for SGI machines you should also subscribe to
SGI's mailing list linux@engr.sgi.com via majordomo@engr.sgi.com.
