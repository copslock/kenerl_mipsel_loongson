OK thanks for the pointer.  I searched SourceForge for "MIPS Linux"
before posting to linux-mips@oss.sgi.com, and came up with "MIPS Linux"
and "Linux MIPS".  Neither project had released files, so I thought they
were dead.  Should I continue to use the linux-mips@oss.sgi.com mailing
list, or switch to linux-mips on SourceForge?
