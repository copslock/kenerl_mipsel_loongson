Yes, I like the ofw_ prefix too, and briefly considered renaming to
that, but decide that dt_ was better due to the number of systems
using the device tree without real openfirmware.

However, the ofw_ prefix would make sense if any of the promtree code
is renamed.

Considering that pretty much all the documentation makes some
reference back to the openfirmware origins, I'm pretty sure the ofw
legacy is safe.  :-)
