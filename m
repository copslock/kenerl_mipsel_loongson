There are several documents pertaining to installing various Linux
distributions on an Indy.  You should probably start with
http://oss.sgi.com/mips/i2-howto.html, which applies to Indy as well.
If you want to use Simple, start at the newly reanimated
http://foobazco.org/~wesolows/Install-HOWTO.html.  For Hard Hat, there
is an Indy-specific document at http://www.linux.sgi.com/manhattan/.
In short, a quick google search and/or the FAQ are more than adequate
to get you started.

*sigh* This really should go in the FAQ.  Expect to see IRIX die at
about the same time the flying monkeys on the moon overthrow Earth by
hurling a giant wad of dung at us with their catapult.
