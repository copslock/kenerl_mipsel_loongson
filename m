Tanks for all the responses so far. I have updated the Wiki page, and I
may do it again after I complete the upgrade.

I put an image of a Raq2 doctored in this way in the Wiki (I just
obtained permission from the author,  Yutaka Yasuda, by private mail). I
don't trust myself enough to attempt that, however; plus I cannot afford
more than one hour or two of downtime - and I don't think I could
unseathe my soldering iron in the middle of the data center :-)
