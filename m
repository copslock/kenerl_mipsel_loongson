This was a long time ago but I still like to finish this. However I'm
not very really versed into this kind of very low level subjects, so
I would appreciate if somebody could tell me if the cache sync is needed
here or not. All I can says is that it currently work on ATH79 which is
a mips32 r2, but that doesn't mean it is correct.

Also note that no such cache sync is done on the decompressed kernel,
wouldn't that also be needed?
