I already tried this one, and it doens't seem to be
the best one: I sent a patch a couple of months ago
to the list, but I didn't get any answers...so I beg
for Ralf to look at it on IRC, but he seems to have 
not time for it...So now I'm trying to find out a new
approach....
Futhermore, this solution can take several months
before every patches have been submitted and accepted.
During this while I'll need to be synchronised with
CVS tree.

regards,

         Francis
