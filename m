You're confusing Onyx with Onyx2.  The Onyx2 is Origin-like and
probably works.  The Onyx is sort of a multiprocessor version of the
Crimson (or, alternately, a graphics-heavy version of a Challenge D).
There were also Power Onyxen, with R8000 CPUs; I can't remember
whether there were r10k versions.
