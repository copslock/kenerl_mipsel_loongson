Keep in mind that all of Linus' work and the whole kernel is GPL'd.  Also,
M$ would have to prove that Linus was on company time to assert copyright
on any code.  From what I have read, Linus has a contract with TransMeta
which specifically allows him some amount of time to work on Linux, so
they would not only have to prove Linus was on company time, they would
have to prove he was working out of bounds of the time specifically
allowed by his contract.  This would be tough to say the least.  Also,
remember that all kernel code is not by Linus, so even in the worst case
we would just have to remove whatever code was truly TransMeta copyright
and re-implement Linus' contribution some other way.

Maybe, but Linux does not live or die by its creator.  I think that if M$
messes with Linus, every other developer will be so pissed, that the
kernel and maybe every other part of Linux will improve at an even faster
rate..  That would certainly give me motivation to burn the midnight oil,
if only I wasn't burning too much trying to graduate.

I've read the GPL and it seems very secure, if it actually applies to the
code Linus rights.  I don't think M$ would even try to argue against
the GPL, they would simply argue that since Linus was on company time that
he did not have the authority to place his code under the protection of
the GPL.  Also, I don't think GNU would have any difficulty getting
support from the rest of the industry in testifying against M$ and in
support of the GPL were M$ to actually challenge the authority of GPL'd
code.

No way, it's a very valid point, but I think that Linux is now strong
enough to function without Linus if it has to, so while your nightmare
could be real, you may be overestimating the danger.

One other point.  I don't think M$ could support any claim of being an
innovator of any new methods of OS design.  They simply bark the loudest
when they finally figure out how to implement 20 year old ideas.  So
even if they succeeded in copyrighting Linus' code, we could just
rewrite it in a different way and then they would have to prove either
that the new code was a more or less direct copy of their code or a
result of disassembling Windoze.  Of course no self respecting Linux
developer would even consider copying or disassembling an inferior OS.

All the same, It might not be a bad idea to keep old kernel sources lying
around just in case this nightmare happens.  I would guess that this has
always been the case anyway.
