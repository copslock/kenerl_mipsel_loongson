Hello.

I've succesfully compiled the 2.4 kernel from linux-mips CVS,
but it oopses at boot time. I'll try to copy and paste by hand
from the console:

Kernel panic: Aiee, killing interrupt handler!
In interrupt handler - not syncing

That's about it. The hardware is SGI Indy IP22 R4600@133MHz 64MB RAM
with the standard built-in graphics and sound. Kernel compiled with
Debian 3.0's gcc-2.95.4. I've since then upgraded Woody to
testing/Sarge. Debian distro kernel-2.4.19 from Sarge boots fine.
If there's any more info you need, let me know.
