Hello,

I'm new to this list and wondering what the status of the port is?

I've been looking at the http://www.linux.sgi.com/mips/manhattan/ site and
it looks really out of date. Is this because it's now in the kernel or has
all support for it just been dropped?

Am I just looking in the wrong place?

Thanks for your time.
