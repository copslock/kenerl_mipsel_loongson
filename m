I'm confused.

I was told on irc a month ago, that someone had gotten an O2 to boot.

Yesterday I tried to fire up my O2. The whole bootp, tftp setup was working 
fine, but when I boot'ed the kernel (linux-2.4.3-ip22) the kernel said "Yee, 
could not determine architecture type <SGI-IP32>". Is this because i'm using a 
wrong kernel or isn't it possible to boot the O2 yet ?
