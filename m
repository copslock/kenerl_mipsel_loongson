       Here's the scoop....the project isn't dead it's just that editing WWW
pages in vi isn't the greatest fun and as I understand it with X, Miguel was
working on getting Xsgi running on top of linux, instead of compiling XFree,
but he's working on gnome mostly right now, so that's just hanging around,
also one of the problems is that the indy docs don't document where the mouse
connects to the system, so even if you got X working you wouldn't have a
mouse.
