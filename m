An addtional update here:

The appropriate parties responsible for the external network which
linus.linux.sgi.com lives on have been notified of the situation
and are (have been) looking at the matter for a while.

Unfortunately I don't have a full-fledged ETA yet, since the "fix"
likely involves some potential work on one of SGI's Internet routers.

Again, more info when I get it.

Sorry for the delay, and thanks for your patience so far.
