I hope you'll excuse us putting this out once on this list.

MIPS Technologies needs a Linux kernel engineer to work in Cambridge,
UK.  We could use you right now!

This engineer will work in a tight-knit team exploiting the
multithreading capacities for MIPS synthesizable cores.

We're a small team, and the successful candidate will get to share in
the everyday, difficult work: maintaining the Linux kernel, testing
toolchains, and debugging new hardware.

This position requires a knowledgeable, experienced software engineer
with significant Linux kernel experience.

You should have a track record of contribution to Linux code,
experience with coding device drivers, strong knowledge of C, and an
understanding of microprocessors at the machine level.

A degree-level qualification is desirable but not specifically
required. 

This position is open to E.U. citizens; however, a relocation package
is not provided. To apply for this position, email resume to
mailto:johnrob@mips.com or mailto:getajob@mips.com. MIPS is an equal
opportunity employer.
