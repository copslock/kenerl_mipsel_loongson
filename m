I thought a few people might be interested in this, it is reported to
run on R4600 Indy
and some of you may know that Linux has been ported to the Intel version
of L4

see http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/+AH4-disy/L4/ for the MIPS version info

and http://os.inf.tu-dresden.de/L4/ for the original L4 page

sorry to those of you who either think this is off, or object to
microkernels in general, but as the source code to this is available, I
thought it may be useful

regards

The word "spine" is, of course, an anagram of "penis".  This is true in
almost fifty percent of the languages of the Galaxy, and many people
have attempted to explain why.  Usually these explanations get bogged
down in silly puns about "standing erect".
