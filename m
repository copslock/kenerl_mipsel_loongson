Dear gentlemen,
  these days, I am busy with porting mips kernel to a board with vr4131 
core. This board has only SIU serial port, and some hw have been modified. 
Now, I have ported the kernel to it, and modified hw run well. But so 
puzzling me, the execution file cann't run at all. If some one can help me 
or give some advices. I have been crazy for the problem. Off hat for your 
help. Thanks a lot.
 btw, I use the ramdisk with busybox.
