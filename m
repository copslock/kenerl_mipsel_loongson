Hi,

Looks like I need to give a status update on linus.linux.sgi.com.

First, let me tell you all that I'm really taken aback by this
situation.  I've seen postings on slashdot.org suggesting that
SGI has taken this machine down because it is in bed with
Microsoft etc. etc. and all kinds of negative speculation and
nonsense.  I was even contacted by the press on this (could
you believe that :-)  Let me make it very clear:

	1) No one at SGI has taken this service down and
	   guess what: we are going to bring it back up again.

	2) The machine itself is not down. The problem is in the
	   routing to the machine and from what I last heard,
	   it seems to be a hardware problem.

	3) I talked to people who can help fixing this and they
	   want to help, the only problem they have is that they
	   have other "real-work" priorities which is why it is
	   talking so long to fix it.

	4) The timing when this thing decided to break (close to the
	   announcement of the SGI Visual Workstation) is purely
	   coincidental.

	5) As far as many of us SGI'ers are concerned, SGI support
	   to Open Source and the Linux community will only grow
	   with time.   See for example Jeremy Allison's cool
	   Samba 2.0 announcement yesterday:

		http://lwn.net/daily/samba2.0.html

	   As some of you know, SGI now is the main founder of
	   the Samba project putting real big money and serious
	   (Origin server) hardware donations to help it grow,
	   improve, and kick butt.

Mirroring linus.linux.sgi.com is a good idea and once it is
back up I encourage more volunteers to step up and do it.

Thanks for your patience and support!

Peace, Ariel
