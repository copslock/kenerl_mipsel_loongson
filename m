I just picked up an indigo2 with irix6.5 on it, but no install cd's.  Is
it possible to install mips-linux with out the irix cd's?  I would like
to wipe the drive clean, and I remember reading that you need the irix
boot loader, is this still true?  Also is there a how-to, web site with
an install guide, or FAQ ?
