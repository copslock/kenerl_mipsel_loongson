The code is complete and practically stable (no serious changes during
a year). Few days ago I had cleaned all errors and almost all warnings
generated by checkpatch.pl, using a script from 3.10 kernel. I need
some time to clean up flash initialization (remove some odd code), but
this is simple task. So yes, the code itself is almost ready for
submission, but I would like to send it in such manner, in which
review would be as easy as possible.

I does not do any forks, all changes were made as patches that were
accepted to owrt. Then I plan to rebase the code on to linux-mips.git
and send upstream.
