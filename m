      Tandem had more lines than that.  They sold the S/3, which was
a triple-modular-redundant UNIX box, with MIPS processors and a hardened
version of MIPS RISC/os, mainly sold to telephone companies.  The S/3
was designed and built in Texas.  They also OEMed various SGI servers and
workstations, notably Indy and Challenge/S systems.   The Tandem versions
of the latter were identical to the SGI versions, except that the plastic
covers were black with a Tandem logo.
