Assalamo Alaykom.
Wasalaam to you(GREETINGS IN THE NAME OF GOD),and how
are you doing?.IN THE NAME OF ALLAH THE BENEFICENT;
THE MERCIFUL THE MASTER OF THE DAY AND JUDGMENTS.
I GREET YOU IN THE NAME OF ALLAH THE BENEFICENT
THE MERCIFUL TO WHOM ALL THE PRAISE(HQ;31:26;17:111)
AND THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
NAMES(HQ:7:180;17:110;20:8;59:
24) BELONGS..

I am HAJIA ZAINAB ABDULKARIM from Libya. I am married
to Late Mallam OSMAN ABDULKARIM of blessed memory was
an oil explorer in Libya and Kuwait for twelve years
before he died in the year 2000. We were married for
twelve years without a child. He died after a brief
illness that lasted for only four days. Before his
death we were both devoted Muslims. Since his death I
too have been battling with both Cancer and fibroid
problems. When my late Husband was alive he made a
huge deposit in millions of US dollars with a Deposit
Company in oversea. (I will tell you the amount as we
proceed). Recently, my doctor told me that I have only
six months to live due to cancer problem. Though what
disturbs me most is my stroke sickness. Having known
my condition I decided to donate this fund to either a

Muslem organization or devoted Muslim individual that
will utilize this money the way I am going to
instructs herein. I want this Muslim organization or
individual to use this money in all sincerity to fund
mosques, orphanages, widows, and also propagating the
word of ALLAH and to ensure that the society upholds
the views and belief of the Holy Quran. The Holy Quran
emphasizes so much on ALLAH'S benevolence and this has
encourage me to take the bold step. I took this
decision because I don't have any child that will
inherit this money and my husband relatives are
into some radical organisations and I don't want a
situation where this money will be used in an Unholy
manner.

Hence the reasons for this bold decision. I know that
after death I will be with ALLAH the most beneficent
and the most merciful. I don't need any telephone
communication in this regard because of my health,
because of the presence of my husband's relatives
around me always. I don't want them to know about this
development. With ALLAH all things are possible. As
soon as I receive your reply on zainababdulkarim@personal.ro
I shall give you the contact information of the Deposit Company in
oversea where the money was deposited. I will also
issue a letter of authority to the Deposit Company
authorizing them that the said fund Have being willed
to you and a copy of such authorization will be
forwarded to you. I want you and the Muslim community
where you reside to always pray for me.
My happiness is that I lived a true devoted Muslims
worthy of emulation. Whoever that wants to serve ALLAH
must serve him in truth and in fairness. I will not
stipulate any precise amount to reward you as it will
have to be on pre-negotiated terms,based on your level
of involvment.

Please always be prayerful all through your life. Any
delay in your reply will give room in sourcing for a
Muslim organization or a devoted Muslim for this same
purpose. Until I hear from you my dreams will
rest squarely on your shoulders.

May the Almighty ALLAH continue to guide and protect
you.
Allah Hafiz.
HAJIA ZAINAB ABDULKARIM
