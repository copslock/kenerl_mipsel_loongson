I guess this code is useful even on CONFIG_SMP=n: to avoid corruption
of the printk internal structures whcih the problematic locking
protects.

When this buffer overflows, which characters get lost?  Most recent or
least recent?

I'm not sure which is best, really.  For an oops trace you probably
want to preserve the least recent output: the stuff at the start of the
output.

hm, dumping a big backtrace in this context seems a poor idea.  Oh
well, shouldn't happen.

len and size should have type size_t.

I find it a bit irritating to have duplicated filenames.  We could
follow convention and call this "internal.h".
