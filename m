I had the chance to take a brief look at this file, and you are right: I
like your newer version better than the older one :-)

It is too bad that it seems this flash area has to be accessed very early=
=20
in boot.  That certainly makes it more difficult to write something=20
particularly elegant.  It is also a pity that it is unknown how to verify=
=20
that the flash MMIO window has been configured before reading from these=20
areas of the address space.  But under the circumstances, calling=20
bcm47xx_nvram_init_from_mem() with the appropriate addresses from the bus=
=20
code during early init, as you did, seems rather reasonable.  I also like=
=20
the code that you added to read the flash data from MTD later in boot.

Here are a few very minor comments that you are welcome to take or leave=20
as you wish.

1. In nvram_find_and_copy(), the flash header copy loop uses:

=09for (i =3D 0; i < sizeof(struct nvram_header); i +=3D 4)
=09=09*dst++ =3D *src++;

Consider using either __raw_readl() to read from the MMIO window, or=20
possibly memcpy_fromio().  In theory, all MMIO accesses should use=20
functions like these.


2. In nvram_find_and_copy(), the flash payload copy loop uses:

=09for (; i < header->len && i < NVRAM_SPACE && i < size; i +=3D 4)
=09=09*dst++ =3D le32_to_cpu(*src++);

Consider using readl() instead of the direct MMIO read & endianness=20
conversion. =20


3. In nvram_find_and_copy(), I don't believe that this is necessary:

memset(dst, 0x0, NVRAM_SPACE - i);

since nvram_buf[] is a file-static variable, and thus should have been
initialized to all zeroes.


4. As with #3 above, in nvram_init(), I don't believe that this is=20
necessary:

memset(dst + bytes_read, 0x0, NVRAM_SPACE - bytes_read);


5. In bcm47xx_nvram_getenv(), this multiple assignment exists:

end[0] =3D end[1] =3D '\0';

Best to avoid multiple assignments, per Chapter 1 of=20
Documentation/CodingStyle.  You might consider running checkpatch.pl on=20
the file:

$ scripts/checkpatch.pl -f --strict arch/mips/bcm47xx/nvram.c
CHECK: No space is necessary after a cast
#101: FILE: arch/mips/bcm47xx/nvram.c:101:
+=09src =3D (u32 *) header;

CHECK: No space is necessary after a cast
#102: FILE: arch/mips/bcm47xx/nvram.c:102:
+=09dst =3D (u32 *) nvram_buf;

CHECK: multiple assignments should be avoided
#195: FILE: arch/mips/bcm47xx/nvram.c:195:
+=09end[0] =3D end[1] =3D '\0';

CHECK: Alignment should match open parenthesis
#202: FILE: arch/mips/bcm47xx/nvram.c:202:
+=09=09if ((eq - var) =3D=3D strlen(name) &&
+=09=09=09strncmp(var, name, (eq - var)) =3D=3D 0) {


6. bcm47xx_nvram_getenv() calls strchr().  Perhaps it would be better to=20
use strnchr(), in case the flash data is corrupted or in an invalid=20
format?


7. There are a few magic numbers in this code, mostly in=20
bcm47xx_nvram_gpio_pin().  It might be worth converting those to macros=20
and documenting the expectations there in a comment above the macro.


8.  The way that bcm47xx_nvram_gpio_pin() calls bcm47xx_nvram_getenv()=20
seems a bit inefficient.  It might be better to loop over all of the keys=
=20
in the shadowed flash, looking for values that match "name".  Then if the=
=20
key name matches "gpio" plus one or two digits, the code could just return=
=20
the digits.  That way, only one pass is needed, rather than 32 (in the=20
worst case).  Well, at least the reads should be coming from cached DRAM,=
=20
rather than flash...

If you fix/address those (or correct my review ;-) ), then you're=20
welcome to add my Reviewed-by: to a patch that moves this file out to=20
drivers/firmware.


regards,=20
