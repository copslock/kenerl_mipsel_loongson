To be honest, my own take on this is that, apart from the compiler
cockups trying to do read only annotations, which affect various
versions of gcc not just the parisc ones, the _devX annotations are
pretty pointless.  They only really do something in the non-hotplug
case, so since 95% of the world seems to use hotplug now and the other
5% doesn't care that much about the odd page of memory (which you rarely
get, since modules sections are accumulated per module, not aggregate),
I'd just favour stripping __init and __exit where there's a problem.

I think we should simply concentrate on __init and __exit; that's where
most of the discard value lies and stop expending huge efforts on the
__devX stuff which adds huge complexity for no real gain.
