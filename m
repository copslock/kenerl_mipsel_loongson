As you note this is a device tree representation, and thus really has 
nothing to do with the capabilities and internal structure of any given 
operating system.

The hardware really is structured as a single controller with a single 
set of registers and register fields that can control multiple "slots". 
  There are not multiple independent slot controllers.

This device tree representation reflects,  with fidelity, the actual 
hardware topology.

But none of this matters, because the device tree bindings train has 
already left the station.  You should have expressed opposition to this 
binding back when it was first discussed:

http://www.linux-mips.org/archives/linux-mips/2012-05/msg00119.html

The device tree is deployed in the boot firmware of shipping devices, 
and we are merely documenting what is there.

Yes.  It's weird, isn't it.

The interrupt controller has 2^20 sources, these are just 10 of them.

As stated above, it is too late to change this.  We could add additional 
bindings if absolutely necessary.

Yes, that is why the property names have a "cavium," prefix.

Well it is a SOC specific driver...  But we will see if it makes sense 
to pull the required definitions into the driver source.

The slots are a reflection of the structure of the hardware.  We are not 
pushing the "slot" concept into the MMC core, so why does it matter?

There must be very close coordination between all the "slots" for proper 
operation.  Forcing us to de-encapsulate this concept will result in 
much less elegant code.  If possible we want to avoid having people 
gouge our their eyes when looking at the driver.

Honestly, I can't see any valid reason why the "slot" concept, wholly 
private to the driver, is at all objectionable.

We will investigate these two to see if they can be improved.
