Attn: Sir / Madam,

Good day, I want to drop you a quick note because I did not hear back from
you concerning the information I sent to you the other day.Incase you did
not receive the letter introducing my intent.


I am contacting you individually for a business transaction involving GBP5.5
Trillion Million and I hope that you will contact me at your earliest
convenient for this possible business transaction.This letter might surprise
you because we have neither met in person nor by correspondence. But it is
one day that you get to know someone.

I am Mr. Peter Lynch, Funds Manager of Fidelity Investment International.
The World Largest Funds Management Company with over GBP1.2 Trillion Capital
Investment Funds, Nevertheless, as Fidelity Funds Manager, I handle all our
Investor's Direct Capital Funds and secretly extracted 1.2% Excess Maximum
Return Capital Profit (EMRCP) per annum on each of the Investor's Marginal
Capital Funds. As a result, I have made over GBP5.5m from the Investor's
EMRCP and hereby looking for someone to trust who will stand-in as an
Investor to receive the funds as Annual Investment Proceed from Fidelity
Marginal Capital Funds.

All confirmable documents to back up the claims will be made available to
you on your acceptance. Meanwhile, I have worked out the technicalities
whereby the funds can be claimed in any of our 6 Clearing Houses without
hitches. Our sharing ratio will be 50-40 while 0.5% will be for expenses
during action and another 5% will go for charity both in our countries.
Should you be interested, Please email me immediately for a detailed
discussion of this transaction.

Sincerely,

From: Peter Lynch (Fund Manager / Shareholder)
