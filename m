I can't share the testcase itself because it has no license and I didn't
write it, but I can tell you what it's doing. (I'll check if I can share
the testcase verbatim too, I just sent an email to the author)

The test spawns two threads, one sending , one receiving. The sending
thread sends 8 bytes of data from /dev/ttyS4 , the receiving thread
receives the data on /dev/ttyS2 and compares the pattern. The port
settings is B1000000 8N1 with rs485conf.flags set to SER_RS485_ENABLED
and SER_RS485_RTS_AFTER_SEND. Sometimes the received data do not match
the sent data, but rather look as if one character was left over from
the previous transmission in the FIFO.

Those two UARTs are connected together by two wires, without any real
RS485 hardware to minimize the hardware complexity (it's easy to
implement that on the pocketbeagle, which is the cheap option here).
