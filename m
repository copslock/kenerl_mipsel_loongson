I only mentioned MIPS to describe the potential side effect of this change. From my current understanding of the DMA API, it would be wrong on other platforms as well. I believe the _for_device function needs to be used to transfer ownership of the buffer back to the device, before calling _for_cpu again later for another read.
This is definitely required in this case, because when the return code is -EINPROGRESS, the driver waits for the hardware to complete this buffer, and the next call has to fetch the memory again after the device has updated it.
This is handled properly by the current code without your change.
