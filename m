Nothing to say so far, except seeing all those "-" signs was quite  
the thrill, since one of the goals of the phylib was to lead to  
reduced complexity.  That said, it looked like there were about a  
dozen PHY-specific code blocks in there.  I saw you submit one PHY  
driver.  Were there others in there that could be ported?

Why is attached_dev not always correct?  I'm not sure if I'm not  
understanding the hardware (I'm unfamiliar with this NIC), or if  
you've misinterpreted the meaning of the attached_dev field.  It's  
supposed to be a connection between the network device and a PHY,  
mainly used for allowing the PHY to signal state changes back to the  
ethernet device.  Is it actually the case that there is one MAC being  
used for two PHYs at the same time?  If so, how do you resolve which  
PHY's state gets used at any given moment?

The same question applies for the code in mdiobus_write()

Do you need to call enable_mac() every time?  If it needs to be up,  
wouldn't it be easier to make sure it's up during bus initialization?

Might want to change that to be "...not 10/100..." or add a case for  
1000.

Stylistic issue (I've seen it a couple times, at least):  don't use  
"{" and "}" if your block only has one line.
ie:
	if (status_change)
		phy_print_status(phydev);
