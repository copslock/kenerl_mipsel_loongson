You can delete everything there except maybe my dot-files. I'm
not actively helping at the moment as I lost access to an Indy
due to a change of jobs (and cities). As soon as I close on a
new house next month, I'm going to start actively shopping for
a used Indy and will thus be able to start helping out again.
