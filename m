Of course you can abstract SoCs using DT, and we do that all the time
now on a lot of architectures. My point is that it's possible to abstract
a board using DT without also describing the SoC in detail, but you
cannot do the reverse.

It's absolutely ok to not have the dts files for each board, and to
not test all combinations, those can always come later if anyone is
interested in it.

The one thing I believe you shouldn't do is hardwire a dtb file to
an SoC specific identifier, because that makes it impossible to
support other boards that need additional DT nodes using the same
boot method. Using a single appended dtb file instead of the built-in
lookup table would solve this well enough.

Yes, this is all good.
