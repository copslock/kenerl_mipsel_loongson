Relative to the other two. Any recommended improvements on this one?

Possibly but the current driver doesn't always save the LCR value before trying to write it. For example see serial8250_set_termios()
	serial_outp(up, UART_LCR, cval);		/* reset DLAB */
	up->lcr = cval;					/* Save LCR */

It's impossible to ensure that going foward the driver will always save the value before writing it. We need to have it saved before since the write will cause an interrupt, hence the save in serial_out.

If that's not acceptable I can audit the driver and ensure all LCR writes are first saved. Maybe comments would reduce the chance of future updates breaking this?

I'm willing to do this, however IIRC there was a thread in late Sept. which came to the conclusion that UPIO were to be used for different access methods and not UART types. Do you see this as an exception?

In the second #ifdef CONFIG_PMC_MSP above the workaround is required because of SoC interrupt design which is out-of-band with respect to r/w of UART registers, it's not specific to the DesignWare UART.

I didn't write the code so I haven't tried it personally but I believe it was investigated.

It looks like the results of the bugs are similar but the causes are different. In the UART_BUG_TXEN case, if I understand the comment correctly, NO interrupt is generated on enabling THRI. This is verified by looking for Transmitter Empty (0x40) and no interrupt.

In the UART_BUG_DWTHRE case an interrupt IS generated on enabling THRI. However no new THRE interupts will occur until a new character is written to the THR and it's sent. This is verified by looking for Transmit-Hold-Register Empty (0x20). 


>	In any case, looks like this errata is auto-detectable just like UART_BUG_TXEN.

I don't know how we would be able to test this without sending junk test characters to the console port. We currently enable the bug flag in our platform setup code when we know the bug is present from the SoC version. Is that not acceptable?

I agree, that was badly named. I've changed it to UART_IIR_BUSY for the next spin.

I can move the code to a function but I still see two issues:
A) We could move the code the a new function. We could also check for a new UART_BUG_* flag before calling the function, but in reality this is a feature of the UART not a bug.
B) How to eliminate the platform #ifdef. How to pass in the address of the UARTx_STATUS_REG in a platform independent way?
We could add it to one of the data structures like uart_port, but it would need an #ifdef in the header file.

Please see my earlier comment on this issue being different than UART_BUG_TXEN.

As mentioned earlier I have now renamed this UART_IIR_BUSY.

From serial_reg.h, the receiver status is 0x06 and no interrupt is 0x01. I thought these couldn't both be set at the same time? In any case this is how DesignWare implemented the status so we can't change it now.

Thanks for the feedback,
Marc
