There are also 63268 and 6828, which follow the 6318/6328 layout;
6818, which follows the 6368 layout, as well as 6358 (Yes I know, very
unlikely to ever get SMP support due to its stupid shared TLB design):

IrqMask
IrqStatus
(several unrelated registers)
IrqMask1
IrqStatus1

and 63381:

IrqStatusHi
IrqStatusLo
ExtIrqStatusHi
ExtIrqStatusLo
IrqMask0Hi
IrqMask0Lo
ExtIrqMask0Hi
ExtIrqMask0Lo
IrqMask1Hi
IrqMask1Lo
ExtIrqMask1Hi
ExtIrqMask1Lo

I see also a 60333, which has three 32bit Mask/Status pairs per
thread, also none of the higher irqs seem to be used according to
_intr.h).

Affinity support is "easy"; expect one set of registers for each
output irq specified, and if there is only one, then we don't support
it / fill the affinity pointers.

As far as I can see, we have three distinct layouts here:

a) An arbitrary number of 32-bit Mask/Status-pairs (3384/6838). No per
thread support (well, not sure about 60333).

b) An arbitrary length (32 to 128 bit) Mask register, followed by a
same length Status register (63xx except 63381, 6818, 6828); repeated
for each thread.

c) A single arbitrary length (currently only 128 bit) Status register,
followed by per thread same length Mask registers (63381).

On a first glance this could translate to three distinct
drivers/compatible properties, where each expects different reg = <>;
contents.

For a), it should be enough to expand the current 7120-l2 driver to
accept/use more than one 0x8 length register, which should simplify
the register map setup.

For b) we could add a a new compatible name (maybe bcm6358-l2, because
that was AFAICT the first one with blocks) that will use the 8 to 32
byte length regs (one for each block). For now we could ignore the SMP
capability of it and make it a variant of the 7120-l2 driver, and when
we add SMP support, split it into a second different driver if we want
to avoid having all the spinlock for register accesses even for a).

We could then even easily document/add the extra block registers /
interrrupts in documentation / the dtsi files before actually
supporting them, because we only have a fixed amount of regs/irqs to
expect in the !SMP case and can easily ignore the extra
registers/interrupts.

For c) we could add a a third compatible name (bcm63381-l2), also with
its own setup routine. I would guess it doesn't matter if both
thread's irqstatus register pointers point to the same region.

For a single driver it probably doesn't hurt that much, but AFAIK
these are also stored in a table, so if all drivers did this, the
table easily becomes huge. This isn't a very strong argument, just
more a smaller nitpick.
