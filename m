  Is anyone on this list currently running Linux on an Origin 2000? I am
looking into setting up an Origin 2000 (16p (R4400 195Mhz)) for my
department and I'm looking for information on Origin 2000 support (i.e.-
which kernels have stable support for it, can I do a native installation
of Linux on the Origin 2000?, etc...).

Thanks,
