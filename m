My GCC experts assert that it is true.

The fact that the Arch Team designed R6 without bothering to determine 
what legacy code does is not relevant to this conversation.

They don't do it either.  But that is not really important.  We can 
easily emulate faulting instructions if needed.

I looked at:
commit 3a18ca061311f2f1ee9c44012f89c7436d392117

And I saw no R6 support.

Is it there, or in some other branch that isn't merged?
