Hi,

Does anyone happen to get the following error message?
Kernel panic: rs_set_termios called

Actually the kernel boots and when the /sbin/init executes, it
gives the above message and hangs. This panic is located in the serial 
drivers but I dont know why they are called.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.


Best regards,
Balaji
