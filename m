Subject: boot different kernels on the indy ?!

Precedence: bulk

i would like to compile and install a kernel from the cvs.sgi.com tree.

i would like not to loose my previous one (the one i get from the woody 
install) as a failsafe option..

i don't understand well i can have multiple kernel booting on the indy..

i believe i should change, in PROM mode, some environment variables.. am 
i wrong?

could someone point me to the right doc?

bye

andrea
