well, from what ive seen the 60 or 70ns 72 pin parity ram sticks should 
work. You have to have them in banks of four. So if you get 4 16megs that 
should be ok.
   I am curious, since I have seen sparks handle large ram in banks of 2 if 
that would work also, but I dont know. Check out DMT technologies for cheap 
ram though, I got 64 megs for approx 34 bucks! They ship quickly too.

Lots o' luck,
James
