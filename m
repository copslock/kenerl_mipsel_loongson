Yes, that's why I might want to run Linux on an O2.  Since it isn't
even an option yet, I'd run IRIX (if I had an O2).  Also, if there was
some bug in IRIX that kept me from doing something but the bug didn't
exist in Linux, I might want to switch.  It is far easier (and
cheaper) to get a bug fixed in Linux than in IRIX.  Especially if you
can't afford the maintenance fees.
