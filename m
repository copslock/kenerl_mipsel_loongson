You should consider that that porting Linus to all of SGI's machines is a
pretty unrealistic project so with all optimism I don't think it's going

Aside of that, SGI's Linux efforts are primarily about the future, not
the past and that's good so.

(Time to mention that I'm not speaking for SGI ...)
