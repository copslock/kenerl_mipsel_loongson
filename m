Hello,

Recently I've been working with various version mixes of the gnu tool
chain for a mipsel-linux target and settled on a patchy binutils
2.8.1/egcs 1.1.2/glibc 2.0.6 setup. However this lacks the functionality
that I would get from a newer toolchain for use with the linux 2.4
kernel. As a result, I was wondering if someone could recommend the
latest "stable"/recommended toolchain for a mipsel-linux target.

Thanks in advance,

Simon
