That's irrelevant, it just makes matters worse because then you
might run into all combinations of big-endian and little-endian
kernels vs MMIO registers.

But they might have a secondary interrupt controller on a PCI card that
uses the same driver in the little-endian mode.

Most peripherals have registers that are designed for PCI compatibility,
and PCI mandates little-endian registers. This has very little to do with
the architecture.

We also have a lot of peripherals that have big-endian registers, e.g
for things that are shared between ARM and PowerPC.

The only hardware that is causing problems is the kind where the hardware
developer tried to be helpful by making it possible to change endianess,
and this is what causes endless nightmares for kernel developers.

I think the easiest solution here is to make this irqchip not use
the irq-generic logic, because it clearly is not generic.

readl has to provide the semantics that PCI devices expect on x86.
On x86, it implies a barrier, so everything else has to do the same.

If you know that a driver does not need barriers, you can use
readl_relaxed(). It doesn't currently work on all architectures, but
it works on MIPS and I have a patch series from Will Deacon that I want
to push to make it work everywhere.
