Hm. I got a call over the Christmas holidays from a Mr. Hu (I think) from
SGI telling me that my machine is no longer under a service agreement.
This comes as a contradiction from what I'd been told by several people at
SGI. 

If this is true, it's not the end of the world; a smack at the back of my
monitor seems to do the trick for now.  I worry abit, though, if something
like my power supply bites the dust.

Can someone like Ariel or David set the record straight?
