Yes,It is true. It is Irix 4.0.5,... sorry , i am mistaken. Ha..ha.
I just got this machine and i am not so familiar with this system. I am
still doing research on it. How powerful actually is this machine? If we
compare it to today's Pentium classes machine, which pentium class has the
same power with this machine?
Does it enough to do some 3D modelling/animation job?
