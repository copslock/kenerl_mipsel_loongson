	Hello;

	I got an Indy 4600SC with 64Megs of memory, and I dont feel like
running Irix on it. What is the status of the sgi port port of linux. Is
there a distro available? Also, I dont have a floppy in my indy, so can I
net boot? If someone point me out in the correct way, I will be very
happy.

	Thanks.
	-C.A.
