: I think the fairest way would be to publish all these
: requests on this forum and have the people who care (us)
: vote on who should get them.  I certainly don't want to
: be the fascist person who decides who gets what.

A nice facist is a good thing.  Voting assumes that everyone has enough info
which may or may not be the case.  I'd suggest that each person that wants
a machine fills out a little form that says

	who am i?

	what will i do w/ the machine?

	when will it be done?
