I think it's an important distinction. It means the problem domain is
supporting all possible instructions, not instructions which can
reasonably have delay slots.

The ability to add arbitrary instructions does not mean that arbitrary
uses of those instructions have to be supported by the ABI. It's
completely reasonable for the ABI to say they cannot be used in delay
slots for coprocessor-conditional branches.

And of course once you're in the realm of custom hardware and software
written to depend on that custom hardware, you know whether you have
an fpu or not anyway. If you have an fpu, you can ignore the
restriction. If you don't, you should follow it. Note that "partial
fpu emulation" (e.g. just denormals) is not relevant here; the issue
only arises if the coprocessor branch instructions have to be
emulated, which means "there's no fpu at all".

My experience has been that hardware and software developers focused
on a particular hardware target are generally unqualified to make
decisions that affect the design and operation of libc or the kernel.
They are not experts in these areas. It was apparent early on in this
thread, when you mentioned the idea that "not all threads would need
fpu support", that you were thinking from a standpoint of custom
low-level software and not a general purpose libc that cannot read the
application author's mind. It seems nobody had thought of the
impossibility of doing lazy setup (inability to handle failure) and
the necessity of always initializing this stuff at pthread_create
time, either. Design issues like this should be run by experts in the
libc area early on, not as an afterthought.

How do you answer Andy Lutomirski's question about what happens when a
signal handler interrupts execution while the program counter is
pointing at this "out-of-line execution" trampoline? This seems like a
show-stopper for using anything other than the stack.

Having the kernel magically do it would be better, but I'm doubtful
that solution works anyway due to the above signal handler/nesting
issue.
