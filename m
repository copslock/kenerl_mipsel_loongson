hello.
i have a board with dual LSI EZ4021. the kernel version 2.4.3 is configured
as SMP & its running. what i'd like to know is, how to confirm? its just a
simple system that is single user & a serial console. for such system where
can i get FREE multithreaded application w/ source code? would you recommend
any particular applications for benchmarking?
many thanks in advance.
girish.
