This is one of the things that weren't done and we want to get done
by the Linux/SGI developers.  I believe that Miguel is one of the
best people to make this happen.  If we can just get his Indy R5000
out of the bureaucratic mess.  Miguel's Indy was shipped three weeks
ago to Mexico and requires a "special permit for used equipment" by
the Mexican customs to be provided by the SGI Mexico City office)

I hope Miguel will send us some good news soon.
