I'm based in France, but should be in Germany this week
for a conference.  If there's a PS2 available there that is
capable of running the Linux port (and capable of booting
up in something other than German and Japanese!),
could someone please let me know the specific PS2
model to look for, and how I could get my hands on the
Linux release???
