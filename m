Hi I have a few questions about installing Linux on an Indigo system.
First off, I was wondering if anyone has ever attempted this before, if so
please email me about any problems you may have had.
Second, if no one has, could someone suggest anyhting that might come
up durring the process of doing so? Right now my box is running
IRIX 6.2, and I was thinking about getting a second hard drive just
for the linux instalation, does anyone have a better way to dothis?
How well is GL supported in Linux? Will the X server start?

Thanks,
Bob Pielock
