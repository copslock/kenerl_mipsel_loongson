This question is more of a formality required by netiquette than anything
else I think.  The NUBI and linux-mips64 lists have not seen any activity
in several years, so I suggest to delete both.  The archives will stay
available on http://www.linux-mips.org/archives/ just as they are now.

Any objections?  Speak up now or forever hold your peace :-)
