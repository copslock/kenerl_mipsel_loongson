I don't think so. It all depends on memory layout of the process, the
execution sequence of tracer vs target, how binary is loaded or how mmap()s
are called. To achieve a balance you need to change current uprobe
implementation. (I haven't explored to change current implementation because
I personally think there is no need to). Let me show you a simple example on
my Ubuntu 18.04 (powerpc vm) with upstream kernel:

-------------
  $ cat loop.c
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <unistd.h>
    
    void foo(int i)
    {
            printf("Hi: %d\n", i);
            sleep(1);
    }
    
    void main()
    {
            int i;
            for (i = 0; i < 100; i++)
                    foo(i);
    }
  
  $ sudo ./perf probe -x ~/loop foo
  $ sudo ./perf probe install_breakpoint uprobe mm vaddr
  $ sudo ./perf probe remove_breakpoint uprobe mm vaddr
  
  term1~$ ./loop
  
  term2~$ sudo ./perf record -a -e probe:* -o perf.data.kprobe
  
  term3~$ sudo ./perf record -a -e probe_loop:foo
          ^C
  
  term2~$ ...
          ^C[ perf record: Woken up 1 times to write data ]
          [ perf record: Captured and wrote 0.217 MB perf.data.probe (10 samples) ]
  
  term2~$ sudo ./perf script -i perf.data.kprobe

-------------

Here install_breakpoint() for our target (mm: 0xc0000000b5072900) was
called 2 times where as remove_breakpoint() was called 6 times.

Because, there is an imbalance, and if you make reference counter a
consumer property, you have two options. Either you have to fix
current uprobe infrastructure to solve this imbalance. Or maintain
a list of already updated counter as I've explained(in reply to Oleg).

Now,

  uprobe_register()
    register_for_each_vma()
      install_breakpoint()

gets called for each consumer, but

  uprobe_mmap()
    install_breakpoint()

gets called only once. Now, if you make ref_ctr_offset a consumer
property, you have to increment reference counter for each consumer
in case of uprobe_mmap(). Also, you have to make sure you update
reference counter only once for each consumer because install/
remove_breakpoint() are not balanced. Now, what if reference
counter increment fails for any one consumer? You have to rollback
already updated ones, which brings more complication.

Now, other complication is, generally vma holding reference counter
won't be present when install_breakpoint() gets called from
uprobe_mmap(). I've introduced delayed_uprobes for this. This is
anyway needed with any approach.

The only advantage I was seeing by making reference counter a
consumer property was a user flexibility to update reference counter
on his own. But I've already proposed a solution for that.

So, I personally don't suggest to make ref_ctr_offset a consumer
property because I, again personally, don't think it's a consumer
property.

Please feel free to say if this all looks crap to you :)

No. Not about updating in one mm. I meant, races in maintaining
all complication I've mentioned above.

Didn't get this.
