Hello,

I'm new to this list, so please accept my apologies if this has been already
addressed.

Why porting it to the R3000? are there any big advantages in doing it? IMHO, it
would be clever and nicer to port Linux to, at least, R5K and above.
Are there any news on this issue?? what's the latest status?

Thanks in advance!


Best regards and have a good weekend,

Martin
