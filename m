Hello All.

All of the systems sent per Ariel's agreement with Todd Johnson regarding
support of Linux development are owned by SGI.  They are all current assets and
should definately be completely supported by SGI as internally owned equipment.

For systems residing in the US, either the user or I can call the Technical
Assistance Center at 1.800.800.4744 to open a service call.

For systems residing in a country other than the US, a service call must be
opened with the local SGI office - as in the case of the repairs to Alan's
monitor.

Should anyone ask, I can be used as a contact for verifying that a given system
is owned by SGI, and more specifically owned by my Director's department.  My
contact information is...

		David Kascht
		Silicon Graphics, Inc.
		2011 N. Shoreline Blvd.
		Bldg.41U  mailstop 827
		Mountain View, CA   94043

		Phone:	+1.650.933.6569
		Fax:	+1.650.932.6569
		E-mail:	dkascht@engr.sgi.com

All SGI representatives, regardless of country, should be able to contact me
fairly easy.

I apologize on behalf of SGI for any problems caused by our bureaucracies!

Take care.  David...
