Hello,

I have an O2 and would very much like to run Linux on it. I was
looking for information on Linux on O2 but could not find any -- I
understand that there is no such usable port yet, but I was wondering
if someone could refer me to anyone working on it, or to work that has
been done already, so that I could follow the progress or maybe help a
bit. Or has no such work been done yet?

	Thanks in advance,
	Adi Stav
