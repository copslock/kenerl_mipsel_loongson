Hmm, maybe, but this wasn't done for legacy reasons.  The system was
designed to run in either endianness, with the understanding that all
software would be built for either LE or BE and that the hardware
would be strapped for one or the other.

On dev boards this is a jumper on the board, but on production boards
it is often immutable.

Right, the intention was to remain source-compatible between LE/BE,
but not binary-compatible.

Either the __raw_ accessors, or dynamically choosing between
readl/ioread32be based on CONFIG_CPU_BIG_ENDIAN (or DT properties, if
absolutely necessary), would work.  We've usually chosen the __raw_
path as it simplifies the code; all we want is a simple "load word"
instruction with no swapping on either LE or BE.

The registers themselves are automatically accessed in native endian
order regardless of the CPU's configuration, due to the way the bus
interfaces were designed.

FWIW, these platforms have 4 different flash controllers, and each one
has its own unique byteswap hardware.

Everything works OK today, but changing the endianness at runtime
could open a big can of worms.

Correct.  It was never a requirement to use a single image for both LE and BE.

The various endianness settings also affect our CPU's "view" of DRAM.
All current BCM7xxx SoCs have extra logic to make sure that packet
data, disk sectors from SATA, and other "bulky" transfers all arrive
in a suitable byte order.

We have this mode available on some of the peripherals, but chose not to use it.

One situation where it can prove useful: for PCIe enable the HW
byteswap, so readl() can be implemented as a straight 32-bit load with
no swap.  The lesser-used 8-bit and 16-bit accessors would then
implement address swizzling.  Other memory-mapped SoC peripherals that
Linux wants to treat as PCIe devices (accessing via readl/writel) can
then be configured for no HW byteswap.

That depends somewhat on whether we're talking about binary-level
compatibility, or source-level compatibility.  For the latter case, we
can always redefine readl() to match the hardware at compile time.  On
MIPS this can be done through CONFIG_SWAP_IO_SPACE.

Hmm, OK.  So it sounds like Samsung used the __raw_ macros to avoid
the barriers, but inadvertently nuked the endian swap.  bcm7120-l2
used the __raw_ macros to avoid the endian swap, and barriers were a
"don't care."

One catch is that almost all BCM7xxx MIPS systems are actually LE, and
BE gets less test coverage.  Some boards cannot even be configured for
BE.  BE has mostly been kept around to accommodate a few customers
with legacy code, not out of a burning desire to support both modes of
operation...
