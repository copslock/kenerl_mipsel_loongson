"No problem - let's sue Flo"	-or-
"No problem - noone will sue anybody"

If you've heared of that company (which will support those old
machines), maybe they're willung to work with us? They've maybe
got all legal rights to software/documentation/thousands of
kilometers of tape archives, but we're (partially) really
working with these machines. So maybe we've got some know-how
in practical terms which they maybe do not have...
