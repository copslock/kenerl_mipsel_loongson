I know:-) But what about the RM600. I've found some announcement
for some SAP monitoring system running on "RM600/LINUX" (can be
found at http://www.save.de/bereiche/ak_s/sap/sap1000/agenda.html).

I found arbitrary texts talking about RM600 and Reliant Unix, but
that's not what I want. (Or do I want to have the 2nd exotic O/S
running?)

MfG, JBG
