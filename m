I just got a SGI Challenge S.  I need advice on which flavor of Linux I =
should install, RedHat or Debian.  Which is the better choice.  I also =
need to find out how to install this.  I already attempted and failed to =
install the RedHat 5.1.  I am using a RedHat 7.0 box to do the install =
(bootp/tftp/nfs) but I am not even able to get the setup to run.  I am =
using the latest version of DHCP/BOOTP (ics 2.0) to try to boot.  It =
gets the address then claims it is sending the vmlinux file via tftp.  =
On the SGI it just times out.

Any advice, pointers, etc would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance,
Robert Ruserk
