while at it, does anyone happen to know what the phy-addr/MAC assignment
on the XXS1500 is?

...or at least, the MAC associated with the particular MII bus should be
brought up if necessary before any mdio access (that's what I'm
implementing right now)

but one thing that seems strange to me; CONFIG_BCM5222_DUAL_PHY doesn't
seem to be defined anywhere; shouldn't that be at least defined in some
Kconfig file, especially if the XXS1550 board is supposed to make use of
it?=20

btw, is the CSB655 supported at all in the 2.6 linux-mips branch, I
couldn't find any mention of it in Kconfig files either?

afaics from the source, it doesn't handle the case of multiplexed phy
notification irqs; although the interrupt is requested with the SA_SHIRQ
flag, the first phy-interrupt-handler to be called already returns
IRQ_HANDLED... doesn't feel right in some way ;-)

thx; in the meantime, I've happened to find the board schematics and the
switch data-sheet in order to understand the situation better
