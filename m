I'm looking at a couple of Indy machines that have 50MHz R4400 CPUs in
them.  What's the going price for this?  There is no memory or disks
or much of anything else included with these machines.  What's a good
price?  The person I'm talking to wants $210

Also, I have a chance to get full systems (with 80M-128M memory,
500M-1G disk) for $525.  This includes monitors, etc.
