Given that what Vernon is looking for is a domain for those hosts that are
	outside of the firewall 
		(yet inside of the packet filter) 
	that dont provide well known service names 
		(www.sgi.com, ftp.sgi.com) 

I was thought of the strip of land around a castle that is between the
outer wall and the moat.   According to the "Castles on the web glossary" 
http://fox.nstn.ca/~tmonk/castle/glossary.html this strip of land is called
the berm.
