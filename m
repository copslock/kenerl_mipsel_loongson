Hi,

does anybody have experience with the LSI EZ41XX line of MIPS cores
and Linux, especially regarding the cache handling?
They have a R3000-like MMU architecture and most of the MIPS2 command
set but a totally different cache.
Without cache enabled the Linux port I did works fine but with cache
the ethernet driver and the MMU behave badly. I thought I implemented
the flushing routines correctly but it seems I missed something.
If somebody already did work on this architecture please let me know.

Thanks,

Ralph
