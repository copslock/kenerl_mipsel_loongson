Mike, please check the pointers (external URLs) mentioned
in the linux archive (did you get my pointer?).

There are also a few good books.  Ralf can recommend some.
The problem is that they don't talk about the newest ISAs
and have next to nothing about low level system stuff.

Also, register to "clubdev" on www.sgi.com (costs nothing)
and you'll have access to SGI's online technical books.

Last option is to contact MIPS marketing (try jackson@mti.sgi.com
Bill Jackson) maybe he can send you some paper docs.
