Good!

I talked with the SGI people in Mexico, still no news regarding the
Indy arrival.

I am going to LinuxExpo to talk about the new Linux RAID-1, 4 and 5
(www.linuxexpo.org).  I am leaving tomorrow morning.  I will be back
on sunday evening, I bet my Indy will be here at my return :-)

Cheers,
Miguel.
