	Bill Gates has explictly stated in several published interviews
	that Microsoft does NOT do software releases ONLY to fix bugs.

	"The only reason to release new software is for features which
	the customers are willing to pay." He even argued that the
	typical "fixed in the next release" quoted by technical support
	was a non-starter.

	I wonder what BillG does when he hits an bug in "his software"?
	What does he do after immediately calling technical support,
	waiting one on hold for 20+ minutes, he is then told
	"It's fixed in the next release", what does he do next?
	File bug report and waits for some new additional buggy feature(s)
	in the next release to arrive?
