If i were you i wouldnt simply kill the installation. Get a second
harddisk, attach it either internal or external, prepare it for use with
linux and finaly swap it with the built in drive on the sled. I recommend 
an IBM drive (faster and not that noisy).

(There is even a special indigo2 page somewhere, but i cant memorize the
URL right now. I guess Florian can help out.)
