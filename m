I fully agree.

If you had to add a missing semicolon to a source file to get it to
build again, it would be an "essential" change (without it nothing
works) but still, you can't claim you added any intellectual value to
the source file. So, no copyright. The copyright is about how much
value you add, not how important the change is in the big picture.

From Documentation/CodingStyle:

"First off, I'd suggest printing out a copy of the GNU coding standards,
and NOT read it.  Burn them, it's a great symbolic gesture."

I'm not going to tell how bad I think the GNU coding standards are, the
point here is that we don't follow them at all, so whatever they say is
totally irrelevant. Read Documentation/CodingStyle, it describes what
we do. Also make sure that you run your patches through
scripts/checkpatch.pl. The rest is up to you, but in general, when
modifying existing code, you want to stick to what the surrounding code
looks like.

I do insist ;) Admittedly, double spaces at end of comments are used in
some places in the kernel tree (I had never seen that before), but they
are still outnumbered by single-space ending comments, 50 to 1. Do
what you want in the drivers your create or maintain, but please don't
change existing comments, especially not in the middle of functional
changes.

That's not a matter of being scared, and I was also _not_ asking you to
split the patch. That's a matter of synchronizing merges between me and
the architecture maintainer. If I take a patch in my i2c tree which
touches architecture-specific files, and I only push it to Linus in 2
months, then chances are that the architecture-specific files in
question will change several times meanwhile, resulting in conflicts in
-next and -mm. I am only trying to prevent this from happening. I
simply think that it is easier to synchronize patches if all
architecture-specific patches go through the relevant architecture tree.

BTW, SWARM seems to be only one of the 4 SiByte platforms we support.
What about the other ones? Your changes to the i2c-sibyte driver could
cause the i2c bus registration to fail, as the other platforms do not
declare I2C devices, the bus numbers 0 and 1 won't be reserved by
i2c-core. Care to comment on this?

Thanks,
