Not in SGML either, but so long as we're talking about the mipsel 
binaries, it may be worth noting that I put together a compilation of 
the RedHat 5.2 mipsel distribution that includes the all the packages 
on the cleveland.lug site, plus quite a few others from elsewhere that 
are either newer than, or missing from, the cleveland.lug distribution. 
This can be found via HTML at http://www.paralogos.com/mipslinux 
or directly by FTP at
ftp://ftp.paralogos.com/pub/linux/mips/RPMS/mipsel/
