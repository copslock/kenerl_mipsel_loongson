Thanks for the patch, Dan and Pete.

I just got back from vacation and tried the patch. The result was same
as what I tested with my code. My card doesn't respond to Command 1,
MMC_SEND_OP_COND.

The controller _seems_ sending the command on the data line; I checked
with logic analyzer.

I've been using Panasonic's SD card, RP-SD064B; and Hagiwara syscom's
MMC card, HB28D032MM2.

is there anything that I need to do use SD other than the patch?

thanks in advance,
