Until I can get Linux up and running I was going to try Irix.

Any roadblocks to this approach that I should know about? Advantages to
Linux on SGI over Irix?

by the way, i saw Irix for sale on ebay, but there was only one cd. is this
a full install. i thought Irix had more cds.

how many cd's for linux on mips?
