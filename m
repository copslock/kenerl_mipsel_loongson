So either the timer driver knows what channels it can't use, thanks to a device property, or it adapts itself when a channel in use is requested for PWM, which is what I tried in v7.

Rob did ack the following binding:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mfd/atmel-tcb.txt

another subdevice is a PWM (not documented here).
