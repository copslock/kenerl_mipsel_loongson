I used to work for an SGI VAR, and we sold expensive (he, he) but SGI approved
third party PCI video cards; I don't remember what manufacturer tough. I
remember one particular customer (an NT shop) who was not comfortable with
head-less servers, and required us to put a head on it :-)

However, I think that if Linux is currently handling the PCI Bus (I think it's
a 64-bit) on that architecture, you can use any PCI video card supported by
Linux ... am I right?
