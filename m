All the developer's Indys that we donated are SGI machines
that have a support contract.  The procedure is to call the
local support office with the ID of the machine (the long number
on the back) and get a field person to replace the part that
needs replacement.  I believe Alan's monitor was replaced
in this way recently.

Miguel: please call your local office and request replacement
of the power supply (most probable) If this doesn't work, they
should be able to replace any part up to the whole motherboard.
