Dear,

[ ] Troller
[*] Idiot
[*] Lamer
[ ] Waster of bandwidth
[ ] Evolutionary Dead End
[*] Clueless Newbie
[ ] AOLer
[ ] "Me-too"-er
[ ] Scientologist


You are being flamed because

[*] You did not provide kernel symbols for your kernel oops
[*] You crossposted
[ ] You are an AOLer
[ ] You posted in ALL CAPS
[ ] You posted in HTML
[ ] You are a troller
[ ] You quoted an entire message in your reply of 0 LINES
[ ] You requested warez
[ ] You flamed someone for a spelling error.
     [ ] ... and you misspelled something in the process
[*] You suck
[*] I just don't like you

To repent you must

[ ] Give up your AOL account
[ ] Go hide under a Bridge.  If you do not have a bridge, we can sell you
     one named Brooklyn
[ ] Go find a hose
[ ] Go to the top of the CN Tower and attempt to defy gravity
[*] Eat your modem
[*] See how long it takes to fall down the Grand Canyon
[*] Shove a Cinnabon into your computer.  Without replacing the case, ground
     yourself to the Power Supply and turn computer on

In closing, I would like to say

[ ] AOL sucks!
[ ] Never post again
[*] Would you like deep fried or extra crispy?
[*] Go back to your little Nintendo, assmunch.
[ ] CAPS LOCK!  It's on the left!
[ ] Die, spammer!
[*] Get a clue!
[ ] Go away!
[*] Learn to read mail archives
