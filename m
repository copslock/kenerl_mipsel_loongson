      As has been discussed here a number of times, the Indigo2 is
not too different from an Indy.  The Extreme graphics, however, are
a challenge to support with open source software, and I do not yet
have authorization to release the hardware specifications for the
EISA interface either (although I keeping working on being able
to release all the hardware specifications).
