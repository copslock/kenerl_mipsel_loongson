Ok, I've asked personally each respective maintainer for an ack or 
comments. Before I've sent my pull request there were only a few comments
on the mailing lists, but this topic have been discussed at ELC-E in Prague
and Linaro Memory-management summit in Budapest (May 2011).

The plan is to use it as a base for further cleanup in the dma-mapping 
implementations, especially on ARM architecture. The changes are designed
in such a way to keep compatibility with the existing users of the API. 
ARM will be the first architecture which will use the new attributes. 
The main clients for this new API will be mainly multimedia drivers (v4l2,
drm) and dma_buf buffer sharing. The advantage of this approach is the 
fact that the same drivers can be used on other architectures without any
changes in the dma calls. The attributes which are not supported by the
architecture will be simply ignored.

Ok, I missed this and I will fix this issue asap.

That was caused by our internal flow of the patches, but I see that it 
made only a lot of confusion. I got my own git repository at 
git.linaro.org and I will resolve these sign-off issues correctly there.

Device dma parameters are global for all dma mapping operations for the 
specified device, while dma attributes can be set for each allocation or
mapping call. Dma attributes are mainly used to provide some hints to the
dma mapping core, which might improve speed/performance/throughput for
some particular sw&hw architectures. Unsupported attributes are ignored,
so the in the worst case a driver gets coherent mapping.
