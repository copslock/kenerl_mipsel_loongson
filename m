lena.fr is completely out of date but still an interesting site for
"Newbies"

For decstation related things the http://decstation.unix-ag.org site
is quiet good.

I thought of an website which clearely states there is an "Linux Mips"
and gives links to development of the different big topics right now
(binutils, gcc, glibc, kernel) and information on the different sub-Archs
like Decstation, SGI, Handhelds etc and gives useful information on how
to install and how to start.
