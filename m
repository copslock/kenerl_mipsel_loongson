I have been working on the design of such a machine for a few months now
as a background project.   The mainboard features are:	PMC RM7000A
400MHz CPU, 2MB tertiary cache, GT64120A system controller, 512K byte
boot prom, DS1501 RTC, 512MB SDRAM, two serial ports (ST16C2552),
OPTI 82C862 USB controller, 4 32-bit 33MHz PCI slots, 2 32-bit 66MHz
PCI slots, ATX form factor.

Prices for the processor and system controller are significantly higher than
the equivilent i386 components in low volume.  High enough volume to get
it to parity with i386 prices is probably not realistic.  From what I've 
heard
some people still don't use Linux. :)

Price for the system will probably be in the US$1200 range.  Send me an
email off the list if you are interested or have suggestions.  The more 
I hear
from the faster it will probably get done.
