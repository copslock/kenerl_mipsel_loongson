   MIPS Chips != SGI systems.  My question still stands.

All your assertion proves is that today IRIX is the "enabling"
software technology which puts "SGI systems" out the door.

Don't get me wrong, I was constantly reminded what keeps the lights on
in bldg. 9 when I was there last summer, but when and if Linux begins
to do some (not all) of that "enabling", people might begin to
perceive the situation a bit differently.
