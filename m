 First of all I don't see much of the need to use soft timers with an 
interrupt-driven PHY.  Most of the state changes could be invoked straight 
from phy_change(), perhaps with an exception for the autonegotiation 
timeout.

 Avoiding a separate work queue was my intent as well.

 Please have a look at how I have rewritten phy_stop() to avoid this 
problem with no need for a lock -- HALTED is set first and only then 
interrupts are masked and cleared for this PHY.  It can be done without 
locking because the interrupt handler is strictly a consumer and 
phy_stop() is strictly a producer and we do not care about any other 
transitions [1].

 The only driver that seems to care is tg3.c and it gets away by other 
means.  Note that network drivers can quite easily handle and ignore 
deferred interrupt work as long as it arrives before they are removed from 
memory.  All that is required is calling flush_scheduled_work() from their 
module_exit() call at the very latest.

 This could work, indeed.

 Agreed.

 There is no problem with accessing the state here -- see above[1] and
below[2].

 Yes.  I would like just to call flush_scheduled_work() here.  But as you 
have noticed, this will most likely lock up if called with rtnl_lock held.  
So the *assumption* here is the caller took care of scheduling this call 
through keventd if rtnl_lock was held at the point phy_stop_interrupts() 
should have been called *or* if the lock was not held and the caller 
decided to call this function directly for simplicity, then the 
flush_scheduled_work() indeed has to be called.

 Hmm, it could just be an omission -- I'll try to recall whether I did it 
for any specific reason or not.

 HALTED is set first, so no race with the interrupt handler[2].

 As you prefer. ;-)
