I was wondering if anyone had any documentation lying around for the 
Lexra LX5820?  Far from being dead it's used in Realtek's RTL8181 
802.11b access point SoC.

I am finding it very difficult to come across any details on just how 
this CPU works (instruction set, MMU, cache etc.) and what differences 
there are to a regular MIPS core.

Any info would help a lot with this project http://rtl8181.sf.net
