Actually the core already takes care of the validity of the index with
the number of pwms being provided to pwmchip_add().

Given that the only difference between the two different implementations
is just the number of pwms provided, this could just be expressed in the
dts as:

	pwm@2000000 {
		compatible = "jz4740";
		num-pwms = <8>;
	}

and

	pwm@2000000 {
		compatible = "jz4740";
		num-pwms = <6>;
	}

instead of

	pwm@2000000 {
		compatible = "jz4740";
	}

and

	pwm@2000000 {
		compatible = "jz4725";
	}

. According to my metric the former is more descriptive and so better.

And then the pwm core could provide parsing of that property (e.g. if
chip.npwm == 0) which simplifies the driver (and all others using that
mechanism).

Regarding the question "Do we actually need this?": We don't, but I
think it would make a nice step to get more descriptive device trees and
so I consider it an improvement. It would also allow to check a dtb
because even without the driver you can notice that

	pwms = <&pwm 12 0>;

is invalid if &pwm has "num-pwms = <8>". Drivers that could benefit are
(at least): hibvt, sun4i, tegra, lpss.

Best regards
Uwe
