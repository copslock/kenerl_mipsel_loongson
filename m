Does this need to be some kind of project then? (Not that I haven't
thought of this already). I realize the KDE and Gnome people are out 
and making fairly decent ground on the WM problem, but maybe this type of
effort should go deeper into the kernel, kinda like BeOS or Rhapsody... 
These are UN*X like oses that are trying to cater to the "I don't give a
shit" crowd of users who don't want to learn anything too indepth about
there computers or who don't have time to deal with stuff because there
trying to work on higher level problems (many academic people, etc.).

What would it take to come up with a Linux distribution in this sort of
flavor that could still use kernel patches and old legacy apps, but also
might have a more standarized GUI/development environment. All this of
course still with a GPL/FreeSoftware attitude...

I know Linus talked about the usability of linux in atlanta this past
summer, so your average joe wouldn't have to deal with such a steep
learning curve, compared to MacOS and Windows...

On these lines what about the stuff that Digital is now doing with Intel.
Digital has been pretty good to the linux community... maybe thats our
"in".
