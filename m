Will there be a SGI/Linux Install HOWTO especially pertaining to the Indy.  I 
have an Indy, but I do not own IRIX, and I can't find any instructions in the 
current howto because it is not meant to be an install HOWTO.  I have also 
heard rumors that SGI eventually plans to drop MIPS/IRIX all togethor and 
that they never plan on offering Linux as a viable OS to it's MIPS systems.  
Am I correct?
