Yes, as I already said, I should have been more specific about this.

Yes I see that.  With git annotate we can even see who wrote it.

The code would be much cleaner if that #ifdef were removed.  The author 
was unaware that a dummy version of pmd_huge() existed in hugetlb.h, 
making the entire if(pmd_huge()) huge block dead code.

I will prepare a patch that gets rid of the #ifdef CONFIG_HUGETLB_PAGE 
in that file.

Ok, then please tell me why:

1) the dummy version of is_vm_hugetlb_page() exists in hugetlb_inline.h?
2) the dummy version of PageHuge() exists in hugetlb.h
3) the dummy version of reset_vma_resv_huge_pages()
4) the dummy version of hugetlb_total_pages() exists in hugetlb.h
5) the dummy version of follow_hugetlb_page() exists in hugetlb.h
6) the dummy version of follow_huge_addr() exists in hugetlb.h
7) the dummy version of copy_hugetlb_page_range() exists in hugetlb.h
8) the dummy version of hugetlb_prefault() exists in hugetlb.h
9) the dummy version of unmap_hugepage_range() exists in hugetlb.h
10) the dummy version of hugetlb_report_meminfo() exists in hugetlb.h
11) the dummy version of hugetlb_report_node_meminfo() exists in hugetlb.h
12) the dummy version of follow_huge_pmd() exists in hugetlb.h
13) the dummy version of follow_huge_pud() exists in hugetlb.h
14) the dummy version of prepare_hugepage_range() exists in hugetlb.h
15) the dummy version of pmd_huge() exists in hugetlb.h
16) the dummy version of pud_huge() exists in hugetlb.h
17) the dummy version of is_hugepage_only_range() exists in hugetlb.h
17) the dummy version of hugetlb_free_pgd_range() exists in hugetlb.h
18) the dummy version of hugetlb_fault() exists in hugetlb.h
19) the dummy version of huge_pte_offset() exists in hugetlb.h
20) the dummy version of dequeue_hwpoisoned_huge_page() exists in hugetlb.h
21) the dummy version of copy_huge_page() exists in hugetlb.h
22) the dummy version of hugetlb_change_protection() exists in hugetlb.h
.

Indeed, you may not realize that akpm has been on the to or cc list for 
this entire thread because I explicitly put him there for this exact reason.
