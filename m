At least for the mvebu dts, the change was added for v4.5 not
v4.4. Currently it is only in the next branches (and also in your
arm-soc tree in next/dt).

It won't be a regression but a breakage of the bissectability between
the patch adding the partition subnode and the one using the compatible
"fixed-partitions".

If you really want avoiding this you could squash the patches, however
from my point of view it's not worth doing it.

I think it won't apply on v4.4 because the partition change was not made
at this moment.
