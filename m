That is certainly one way of looking at it.  Really it is opinion, 
rather than fact though.

GLibc is full of code (see ld.so) that in earlier incantations of 
Unix/Linux was in kernel space, and was moved to userspace.  Given that 
there is a partitioning of code between kernel space and userspace, I 
think it not totally unreasonable to consider doing some of this in 
userspace.

Even on systems with hardware FPU, the architecture specification allows 
for/requires emulation of certain cases (denormals, etc.)  So it is 
already a requirement that userspace cooperate by always having free 
space below $SP for use by the kernel.  So the current situation is that 
userspace is providing services for the kernel FPU emulator.

My suggestion is to change the nature of the way these services are 
provided by the userspace program.

Why?  This adds overhead for threads that don't use the FPU.  So this 
suggestion adds at least one page of memory overhead for each thread in 
the system (unless I misunderstand what you are saying).

Yes, there are 2^32 possible instructions.  Each one is 4 bytes, plus 
you need a way to exit after the instruction has executed, which would 
require another instruction.  So you would need 32GB of memory to hold 
all those instructions, larger than the 32-bit virtual address space.
