Subject: using ec3 on a Challenge S
Date: Wed, 28 Apr 1999 10:07:50 -0700
X-Mailer: Internet Mail Service (5.5.2524.0)
Sender: owner-linux@cthulhu.engr.sgi.com
Precedence: bulk


The situation:
  I inherited 20+  SGI Challenge S machines that I would like to use for 
  web test clients and/or DIPC personal projects.  I would like to use
  the second Ethernet port (ec3 in Irix) for something other than dust
  collection.  I've read the list-archive, and there was a brief mention
  of adding some probing code to the driver but that was all.

What I'd like to know:
  Is anyone working on this right now?
  If not, I'd love to try to get this working, but I haven't done any driver
work before, 
  so where's a good place to start?

Also, www.linux.sgi.com is refusing http connections for me, 
is anyone else having a problem with this? 


Thanks for everything.
