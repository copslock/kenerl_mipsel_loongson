That's the point, MIPS is making a healthy profit from _non-SGI_ products
though like Windows CE, N64, Playstation as you suggested. Not that I have a
problem with that...

But the best we have right now are 200MHz R10Ks, so we are relying on our
server architecture to compete with everyone else. We all hope that MIPS can
continue to produce chips that are competitive (and the R12 looks great on
paper), but Intel has a lot more engineers and R&D budget to leap frog ahead in
the long run. That's life.
