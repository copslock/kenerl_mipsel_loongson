I am trying to boot an Origin 200 (which I believe currently has IRIX on
it, I will be installing linux-mips).  It has 2 9 pin serial connectors on
the back.  I have hooked my Wyse terminal up to it with a serial cable
with and without a null connector @ 9600bps.  Is this correct?  I get
nothing on the screen.  I have never consoled into an Origin, and am not
sure if I am doing this right.

Brian
