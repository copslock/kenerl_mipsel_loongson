Mgix,

Glad to see you're still with us in a way!

How to get started:

Yes, this is *the* most important missing piece on www.linux.sgi.com
It should be the first item in the 'HOWTO' section.

I believe we used to have at least two volunteers to write this
a few weeks ago.  I hope they are listening, (no names :-)

If anyone else who has Linux running today would like to write this,
please do.  Make sure you make it short, accurate, reproducible
and as simple as possible.

If you need shell access to administer the linus web site from where
Miguel and I left it, just let me know and I'll give it to you
(you'll need ssh and email me your public key generated
with ssh-keygen)

:Hi,
:
:I have this 2gig drive sitting on my desk next to my Indy and
:doing nothing, so I figured I should try to install sgi-linux,
:see if the thing boots, and maybe put togehter a few RPM's
:on my own
:
:Unfortunately, at this point in the project, the "How to get
:started" part is kind of not written anywhere.
:
:I think if someone could whip together a quick 5 steps to booting an
:Indy under Linux and post them on http://www.linux.sgi.com, it'd
:be great, especially for people like me who are more the userland type.
:
:I have access to a i586-SCSI Linux system on the same network as
:my Indy, so I guess it should make things easier (booting diskless
:and/or making an efs filesystem on my SCSI disk on the PC)
:
:Thanks,
:
