Category: DBAu1500 board question

Dear sirs. Few days ago I started the work with DBAu1500 
but unfortunatly among included software toolchain I 
didn't find 
any utility to download startup code into clean flash.

Does anybody have any flash programming utility wich 
probably works via EJTAG to download code to DBAu-flash or 
if I have absolutely clean or bad written flash due to 
uncleanly interrupted programming process for example due 
to power fail I need to insert it to the programmer to 
download boot software? 
I can not belive that there is no any simple utility 
working via LPT-port to do this.
Pls. help me find such utility and a primitive sheme with 
one HC244 and few resistors how to solder an adapter from 
LPT to JTAG.

  Thank u in advance.
