Cool!  Now that things are working a bit better on my box, I'm a little
more eager to get things running smoothly.

Uh, could you let me know where?  I couldn't find either. The only RPMs
are ed(no, please, don't make me)  and the broken version of joe.

I've had SRPMs of RedHat 5.0 (Hurricane) for a couple of days, so when I
get my build system running well, it'll churn out the upgraded RPMs.
Having compiled a few things this evening, I can tell you it'll take a
long time.  The 4600 isn't as fast as I'd thought.
