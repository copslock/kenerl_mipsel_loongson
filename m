If I've correctly read the datasheet of the switch, the sync status bit
is in the MAC address space. Same for 1000BASE-X/SGMII, autonegotiation.

The point I was trying to make was that this driver isn't only for
"muxing". There are also a handful of registers for
(electronically-related ?) features of SerDes (e.g. "control of phase
regulator logic", "deserializer phase control", a few
thresholds/hysteresis/frequencies, etc...

I understand that "serdes" isn't also fully matching the work done by
this driver as some features are handled within the MAC controller
address space.

Let me know if something bothers you/does not make sense,
Thanks,
Quentin
