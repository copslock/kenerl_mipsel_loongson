I had a question about the cross compiler tools for MIPS, specifically
glibc.  I d/l the rpms from oss.sgi.com,  but they are only binutils, and
the compiler (C, C++).  

Are most people building glibc against these or are you building the tools
completely from scratch?  As glibc is needed to compile anything else other
than the kernel.
