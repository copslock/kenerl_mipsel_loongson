Gone (leftovers from debugging MMC and other non-working cards)

Good point, I'll add named constants for other values as well.

It did-- but since I was just shuffling code around I was hesitant to do
these changes as well in this particular patch (the i2c maintainer for
instance wants functional and cosmetic changes in separate patches;
and every maintainer has different preferences, so I left those lines
untouched to not add additional noise).

Yes you're right (but this line never triggered while testing so it's
harmless).

I like the renamed function, but again, I was just shuffling code around
(more or less) so I didn't touch the name(s).
For the time being, I'll leave it as-is, and if someday Au1100 DMA is added
the functions can be renamed or beautified with tons of ifdefs.
What do you think?

Based on HOST_F_ACTIVE the driver determines if it is possible that there's
a card in the socket.  Again, I just did code shuffling here.

Are global vars initialized to zero on module load?  Then it can go away of

Too much to type for my taste, but okay, changed.

The db1200 board stuff references the ->id member to determine which BCSR
bits it should pay attention to.  It can go into the driver code if you are
okay with adding platform data for every one of both SD controllers on the
PB1200 (which means lots of duplicated code which only differs in BCSR
constants).  I'm okay with eiher solution, which do you prefer?
