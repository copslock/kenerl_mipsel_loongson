yes,  actually the top two bits are used in MIPS as segment bits.
For 64 bit MIPS machines there is a bigger physical address space.
In our case, we used either 128MiB or 256MiB blocks or RAM and they
are separated by holes at least that big. It seemed reasonable that that was
the biggest value that I could make it.

One thing that I had thought about and also came up when my peers here
reviewed my changes was that we probably could put those bit numbers
(at the very least the segment size) in the .config file.

we decided that the power that be might have had a reason for that and
we left it not wanting to meddle with the other arch's.

Dave, do you have a comment about that?
