Hi All,

First some good news. We are again making some progress
on the SGI/Linux front. In fact we have two great people
taking over the effort (Ralf and Miguel).

I summarized the recent events on:
	http://info.engr/linux/status.html

If you care about the matter and would like to see
the port completed soon, please read and let me know
if you can help.

Peace, Ariel
