 I have to agree with Chris (a rarely do :-). Past behaviour
of SGI has been that of a "HW oriented Systems Vendor". Which
does not mean that the SW we ship is not important (to the
contrary), but revenue (and profit) come mostly from the sales of
HW.

 Only recently we seem to have discovered that some of our SW
products make us real profit. Now, should we transform ourselves
into a software company? I don't think so. I would like to
see us as a solutions provider (HW+base-SW+Added-Value+Support).
Long way to go for us.

 Of course, he did not make his wealth by giving away the
software :-)

  Yes, the almighty god of the Businesscase :-)
