The couple idle state was introduced to compensate hardware mis-design.

There are a couple of examples omap4 and exynos4 where only CPU0 can do
some PM operations. AFAICT, from the feedbacks I got, couple idle state
consume more energy than it saves (very likely because of the busy loop
sync mechanism).

I did some tests with a 4 cores system and the overhead was so high the
system had a very bad response time, so dropped the cluster idle state.

So before going further in the couple idle path, I suggest you
investigate first a sync mechanism which may be implemented by the
hardware. One good example is the cpuidle-ux500.c.

With a proper last man standing sync, we can then take care of the timer
broadcast thing. I can give you a hand for that if you need.

Perhaps, you can upstream the external timer driver first?
