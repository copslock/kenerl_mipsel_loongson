What's the preferred endianness for Linux-MIPS?  I can't really go
into why I'm asking (sensitive NDA information), but I'm basically
faced with a group that wants to work in LE.  However, my
understanding was that Linux-MIPS generally ran BE.

Or can it be built either way?  I know OpenBSD runs LE.... not like
that means anything to this group, tho.
