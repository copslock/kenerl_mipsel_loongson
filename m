Hi ! 

Who have any technical reference to PMAGB-B card ? 

I have DECstatoin 5000/200 with  this card, but dont have 
any documenation for it. I try switch on-off  jumpers on PMAGB-B card. 
After this procedure my DECstation go to cycle video test after 
power-on. I can not boot from machine. 

How solve this problem ? 
  
Best regards
