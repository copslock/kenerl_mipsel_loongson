Yes, that's what I think it means.

Bottom line is that it is up to us (SGI) to provide the support for
IRIX.  There are various people throughout SGI who do testing and
debugging on our systems and feed them back to FSF.  For example, I'm
on the Emacs pretest list.  I usually get early releases of Emacs and
test it on various boxes before it is released.
