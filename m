I have a few simple questions that I have been wondering about.  I am
currently running the debian verison of Linux with 2.4.0 kernel on an
Indy.

1) What is the difference between the Redhat and debian verison of linux?
Should I use one over the other for my Indy?

2) Is there a JVM/JIT available for MIPS Linux?

3) Is there something that is available to replace sash, another
bootloader?

thanks for your time,
john davis
