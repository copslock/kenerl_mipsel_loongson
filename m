Hello, folks (of both lists)

I recently got both an R4k and an R3k SGI Indigo. 

I know, none of them is supported at the moment.
So, I want to try to change that.

I hadn't started yet, but every help is appreciated.

CU,
	Achim

P.S.: This was posted to both lists, as I don't know, which OS 
has the better starting point for my computers.
