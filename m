I'll look into it for the next patch.

No because this peripheral is across an internal SoC bus. Only a read
accessing it will ensure the write is complete. We must insure the
interrupt source is cleared to avoid spurious interrupts.

Since we don't require it I will drop the 8250_early.c changes from the patch.

I've tested the "mm tree" patch for the backup timer and it works, although
the output seems a little choppy at times. I'll drop the UART_BUG_DWTHRE flag
and associated code.
