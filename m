There are these brand new services just out called Google and Wiki!!!
You should try them out. They're revolutionary!! All kidding aside,
go to:

    http://www.linux-mips.org/

which is the main site. The link directly to the toolchains is:

    http://www.linux-mips.org/wiki/index.php/Toolchains

more information about emulators/simulators is:

    http://www.linux-mips.org/wiki/index.php/Emulators

All of the information that you are looking for will be there. Have
lots of fun. Please feel free to ask questions after you have exhausted
those resources.
