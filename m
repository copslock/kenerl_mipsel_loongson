Hi

I was wondering if there are any JVM and JITs on Linux with support for the 
extensive Java
libraries and would run on MIPs machines?

Kaffe doesn't seem complete enough and Blackdown doesn't have a MIPs 
download
available.

It doesn't have to be free - we would be ready to license software. If 
anyone knows
of any companies that do this I'd appreciate the information.

thanks.
