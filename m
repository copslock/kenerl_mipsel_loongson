OK

Open source development may require both.  for example, let's say I want
to buy a PS2, open it up, add some goodies, and then sell, release under
GPL, gift to the public domain, etc., my derivative work.

I want open programming models and open design information down to the
schematic, board layout, and parts list level.  The insides of
integrated circuits can remain secret so long as their operation and
interfaces are completely documented and there are no IP entanglements
when I want to design, publish, build, sell, give away, etc., circuits,
software, and products which use them.
