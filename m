Hi,

Has anyone put MIPS16 based applications on Linux 2.4.2 kernel? We 
want to use this to get more flash storage but unaware of the 
issues behind this. For ex: how will the loader work; will shared 
libraries compiled with MIPS16 work with MIPS32 applications. Can 
anyone thow light on this topic or point to us to some relevant 
documentation?

Thanks in advance
Raghav
