Hello guys,


I've attempted to find info on running Linux on an O2 machine,  what I
found is that there is no current port.

Say I'd like to have a go for it, however painful it might be,  please
give me some pointers, on how to start
with such a port,  any info will be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
                Marc Esipovich.
