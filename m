I dont think they mean THE RM600 or they mean RM600/Reliant=20
and/or Linux/i386

The RM600 is big endian only AFAIK and was running Sinix/Reliant
only. The RM200 port which existed and which might be completely=20
outdated and non-functional now is for little endian which
the RM200 were delivered with for running Windows-NT.

Thus - Its a completely new port ...
