I agree.  I'm not sure, but how much are we really giving away if we
provide some of our software to the linux community?  Imagine the
proliferation of OpenGL software that would be generated and the
number of computers we would sell if Joe Shmoe could buy an O2 with
Linux and OpenGL support?  SGI is a hardware company!  It surprises me
that much of our company has forgotten that.
