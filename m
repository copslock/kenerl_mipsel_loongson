Manuel et al.,

I've tested these patches on a DB1200 board and they look good.  I have
an Au1xxx IDE power management patch that depends on them that I can
release after they've been applied.

One catch - these no longer apply to the latest HEAD.  Manuel, can you
re-spin and re-post them one more time?

-Kevin
