Hello all,

I apologise before the audience for double-posting of my last several
messages.
My mail server seemingly confused me, saying that during last few hours
the mail was not sent.
I blindly re-posted messages, and later on accepted a confirmation about
my previous posting.

Sorry again,

Michael.
