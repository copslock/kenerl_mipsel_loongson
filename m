Give those who wrote the PR the mercy of the doubt ...

Sam was on the SGI payroll when he was working on HylaFax
and so were many others SGI employees contributing to free software
even before 1994.  Besides, you are right, certainly with regards
to Linux.  it should have been 1996.

:Times have changed since then ...
