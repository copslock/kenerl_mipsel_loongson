Hi,

I tried to install Linux on our SGI 540, using the 28jul... kernel patch
from a SGI web page. It went well and boots until the point where I
should see the login screen - but all I get is a "noise" pattern. I am
quite new to Linux, but it sounds like the XF86Config is not right. Does
anyone have a XF86Config for a 21'' Monitor (GDM-5021-PT)? Any help and
suggestions welcome!

Thanks in advance,
Christian
