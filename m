Dear Sir,


This letter may come to you as a surprise due to the fact that we
have not yet met,but it shouldn't,since we are determined to get what 
rightly belongs to us anyhow,but soon when every thing goes according to 
plan.The message could be strange but reality will definitely dawn on you, 
if you pay some attention to it's content. I wouldn't have notified you but 
for the sake of your integrity and goodwill.Please accept my sincere 
apologies.In bringing this message  to you, I have
to say that I have no intentions of causing you any personal pains or 
discomfort.


I am Mr.Samuel Savimbi, son of the late rebel leader Jonas Savimbi of Angola 
who was killed on the 22nd of february 2002.We are desperately
looking for a trustworthy person to assist us in this confidential
business.My late father, Jonas Savimbi  deposited  huge sums of money
realised from the sale of diamonds and other precious stones /metals
in different banks in Europe. My father is presently no more, and the
movement of his family members (including me) is highly restricted. We are 
forbidden to either travel abroad or out of our immediate localities. 
Presently, the money realised from those sails amounting to US$28,500,000.00 
(TWENTY EIGHT MILLION,FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS),which my father 
realised was transfered  to Netherlands is
safe  in a security firm over there.Before you can get access to it you have 
to be given the password and the Personal indentification numbers (PIN 
No:)of the consignment deposited.I am  ! ; therefore soliciting your help to 
have this money collected by you and ransfered into your account,as we would 
give you the neccesary documentations to facilitate your collection of the 
consignment personally in Amsterdam, before the government gets wind of this 
arrangement.You know my father was a rebel leader in his life time before 
his death.My reason for doing this is because it will be difficult for the 
Angolan Government to trace my father's money to an individual's 
account,especially when such an individual bears no blood relationship with 
us ,I have decided to keep that money for my family's use.  Presently the 
money is still in that Security Company in the Netherlands. I am currently 
and temporarily living in Luanda with my family seeking for my refugee 
status,moreover the political climate in Angola at the moment is very 
tense,sensitive and unstable.With this password and informations that we 
will give
you,together with the Power of Attorney,you! will then proceed to the 
security firm,and these will facilitate your collection of the consignment. 
You have to proceed personally to Netherlands where after fulfiling their 
requirements US$28,500,000.00 will be released to you in the two large trunk 
boxes that it was deposited in,after which we may likely ask you to come 
over with some money for us to run away from here at least for now into one 
of these European countries. You can
have the fund  transferred into any account that suits you after your 
personal collection of the consignment,until furtherinstructionsare 
given.PLEASE  YOUR CONFIDENTIALITY IN THIS TRANSACTION IS HIGHLY REQUIRED.
Thank you very much for your time and understanding.


Yours sincerely

Samuel savimbi.
