Hi,
I try to load a linux image to a malta-5kc board with
a hw debugger.

Before I load the image I load YAMON in order to
initialize the board.

This doesn't work and I have understood that I have to
set up some of the cpu registers to certain values
(like for command line parameters, etc.)

Could anyone help me with that?, which registers and
to what values?

Thanks,
Amit.
