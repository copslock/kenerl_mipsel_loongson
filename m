Thanks for detailed information.
I don't think that this must work for *every* platform, too, and it's
not expected from the driver.  The systems without uncached memory
access can simply return an error from  dma_mmap_coherent() call, so
that the driver can disable the mmap.  That'd be enough.

The current problem is that such an architecture / platform specific
thing isn't exposed at all.  If the driver suppose that mmap would
work as if normal pages, then it results in a crash.
The dma_mmap_coherent() can hide ugliness inside the arch code, and
also can give you an error if unmappable, at least.

Now, how to handle these exceptions: a question comes into my mind
again -- how does the framebuffer handle these as well?
Any pointer appreciated.


Thanks!

Takashi
