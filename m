Ok. Any better idea?
I think if we don't track all mms patched by uprobe, we have to rely
on current instruction.

Hmm right. Probably, I can fix this race by using some lock, but I don't
know if it's good to do that inside uprobe_mmap().

That boolean is needed because consumer_filter() returns false when this
function gets called first time from uprobe_register(). And consumer_filter
returns true when it gets called by uprobe_apply(). If I make it
unconditional, there is no effect of setting REF_CTR_OFF_RELOADED bit. So
this boolean is needed.

Though, there is one more issue I found. Let's say there are two processes
running and user probes on both of them using uprobe_register() using, let's
say systemtap. Now, some other guy does uprobe_register_refctr() using
'perf -p PID' on same uprobe but he is interested in only one process. Here,
we will increment the reference counter only in the "PID" process and we will
clear REF_CTR_OFF_RELOADED flag. Later, some other guy does 'perf -a' which
will call uprobe_register_refctr() for both the target but we will fail to
increment the counter in "non-PID" process because we had already clear
REF_CTR_OFF_RELOADED.

I have a solution for this. Idea is, if reference counter is reloaded, save
of all mms for which consumer_filter() denied to updated when being called
from register_for_each_vma(). Use this list of mms as checklist next time
onwards. I don't know if it's good to do that or not.

No, because uprobe_register() is simply NOP and breakpoint is actually
installed by uprobe_apply().

This is a valid concern. So, this point is forcing me to make it a consumer
property. But if I do that, all optimization done by uprobe_perf_open() and
uprobe_perf_close() needs to be reverted, which I don't want to.

Hmm incase of failure, this could be possible.

No, you are right.

Please let me know if you have any better approach.

Thanks for the review :)
