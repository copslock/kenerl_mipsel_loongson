Hello everybody

I'm working on Linux compatibility on NetBSD/Mips. In order to implement
things such as signals, I need a user account on a big endian Linux/Mips
system.

I would use this account mainly for building and running tests programs,
in order to check that our Linux emulation is accurate.

Anyone can helop here?
