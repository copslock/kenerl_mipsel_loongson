Thank you all for your suggestions.  I have ordered a 3.5 GB Seagate Fast
SCSI-2 hard drive to put in the box and will then try to get it up and
running with IRIX first, then Linux.  Is the statement in the FAQ still
correct that you need IRIX in order to boot Linux?  Is it sufficient to
have the IRIX installation tools on CD?

Mark
