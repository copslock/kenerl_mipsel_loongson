The MIPS embedded market is large enough to give you a living on the base
of Linux/MIPS.  I wouldn't dare to say that about the Linux for SGI market
yet ...  The big problem is just finding the initial customers.  Living on
the base of Linux is however getting easier and easier.  About half of my
income the last year was based directly or indirectly on Linux and it's
getting more.  And yes, it's good enough to afford non-rusty cars ;-)
