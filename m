      I apologize for SGI for the long delay.  I just clarified to the
support people that it is indeed a critical resource, and they say it
should be back within two hours.  Some failed hardware (not,
apparently, on that machine itself) is being replaced.  For the longer
term, I will work on assuring more stable service.
