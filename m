Greetings.

I have added four new pages of content to the website for the
Philips Nino port. You can check things out at:

   http://www.cotw.com/projects/nino/port

I have uploaded my latest kernel source as well as a precompiled
kernel image. Please read the new pages starting with the page on
the bootloader. I will finish the remaining pages tomorrow complete
with screen shots, VMWare setup, etc. The touchscreen driver will
be complete this week.

-Steve
