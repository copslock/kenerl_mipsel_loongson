For the thread associated with this patch set, a review of a previous
patch for ARM posted last Tuesday on this subject asked a series of
questions about the PCI-nature of this.  The review has not been
responded to.

If it is inappropriate to offer RapidIO for any architecture that
happens to has PCI, then it is inappropriate to offer it for any
ARM machine that happens to have PCI.

In light of the lack of explanation on this point so far, I'm naking
the ARM part of this series for now.

I also think that the HAS_RAPIDIO thing is misleading and needs
sorting out (as I've mentioned in other emails, including the one
I refer to above) before rapidio becomes available more widely.
