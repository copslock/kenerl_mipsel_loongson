Go to http://www.sgi.com and search for "Systems remarketing" - there
is also a link to their home page on http://www.linux.sgi.com. The
":best" part about these systems is that if purchased today with any
kind of hardware support you would also be elegible for IRIX 6.54
upgrades when they become available in the next month or so.
