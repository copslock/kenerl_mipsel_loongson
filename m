Subject: linux/mips on cd?


does anyone sell a CD of linux-mips?

I'd like to try linux-mips in production use as my dialup
firewall. (security thru obscurity: let's see those script kiddies
find 'sploits' for linux/mips!). However, i don't have the bandwidth
to download the distribution.

if anyone is selling CD's, or if anyone would be kind enough to burn
a CD for me, I'd be very grateful if they'd contact me off-list.

thanks,
