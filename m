linux-mips@oss.sgi.com:

Hello!  I have the opportunity to work on MIPS Linux using a MIPS Atlas
(4Kc) board.

1.  Is there a reason why SourceForge isn't being used for the MIPS
    Linux project?

2.  What is the preferred host OS for MIPS Linux kernel and application
    cross development (especially the MIPS Altas)?

3.  What is the preferred toolchain for MIPS Linux kernel and
    application cross development (especially the MIPS Altas)?

4.  Is MIPS Linux self-hosted?

5.  Can you do native development on MIPS Linux?

6.  Does MIPS Linux support sound (oss or alsa) on any platform?  Does
    it support sound on MIPS Atlas?


TIA,

David
