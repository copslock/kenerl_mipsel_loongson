I believe the _for_device function needs to be used to transfer ownership of the buffer back to the device, before calling _for_cpu again later for another read.

> I think you're missing something. It works like this: In the AR9380 rx path, the descriptor is part of the skb. The rx tasklet checks for rx frame completion by calling the sync for cpu, reading the completion flag and (in case of a not completed frame) flushes the cache for that location again (for device). If you remove the for_device call, the next call to this function can see stale data, as the for_cpu call can be a no-op.

Is the descriptor modified in any way before being checked again? Looks like
it isn't. That is my assumption - if this doesn't hold, then we're talking
about different things.

When I looked through the DMA API implementation for MIPS, I saw that whenever
sync_to_cpu is a no-op, sync_to_device is also a no-op. So the bug you're
seeing is not related to those calls. It might be that despite no-op sync
primitives, the platform is not cache-coherent --- that is DMA writes by
device do not cause corresponding CPU cache lines to be invalidated.

BTW, cache flush (other name: invalidation) is needed just before reading the
value. Doing it once more earlier does not really matter. Unless you're
modifying some data in the same cache line as mapped buffer --- then this
is a BUG in the driver and should either use DMA_BIDIRECTIONAL if the modified
value is part of the buffer, or move the modified data away.
