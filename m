     With the approval of Tom Furlong (then the SGI VP/GM in charge of Indy),
I provided the specification to the Linux-on-SGI project (in the person
of David Miller :-) ).  It is only available in paper, and David may be
the quickest source for it.  (I am now in a different division, far from
the home of the paper documents.)
