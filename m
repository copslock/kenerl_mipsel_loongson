The current mainstream memory offering is 70n/s and we are at 50n/s.  The memory is not proprietary - any manufacturer could buy it if their system could drive it fast enough!

SGI couldn't.  SGI had to replace so much of the IA/440xx chipset that there
had to be a prettty big agreement with Intel covering a lot of issues,
machines, processors, and markets to allow SGI to, for example, implement
the frontside bus in their own chipset.  Don't forget all those Co'op
marketing dollars too. -dong ^dong -dong ^^dong

Yeah, but Intergraph is lame so they had that working against them too. :)
