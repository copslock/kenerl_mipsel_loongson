Have you had a high failure rate?  We just bought 8 O2Ks with 12 CPUs
each.  We are supposed to take delivery next month.  The 2 single-module
Integrated Test machines we've gotten seem to work great.  These machines
will be used in a high-availability environment (4 nines, moving to 5
nines with FailSafe 2.0).
