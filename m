There's quite a lot of issues here.  At a high level the big issues are
with duplicating core functionality, a large number of helper functions
that don't seem to add much and some interesting locking.  There's also
no DT binding documentation which is mandatory for new bindings.

Note the comment here (yes, there are some things out of order but
that's no reason to add more).  Please also add an || COMPILE_TEST
unless there's an actual build time dependency.

Similarly here where things are better sorted already.

What should we refer to dw_spi.c for?  If this is a Designware IP you
should share the same driver.

What is the cpu_relax() intended to do here?

This is large for an inline function and only has one caller anyway.
Why not just include it in that user?

Why do you need this cast to void?

A busy waiting loop like this is more where I'd expect to see a
cpu_relax().  I'd also expect to see some kind of timeout here,
otherwise if something goes wrong we could lock up.

Essentially all the functions in this file appear to be marked as
inline.  Don't do this unless the function really *needs* to be inline,
just let the compiler inline it if it figures out that it's a good idea.

I don't really know what the above is suposed to do just from looking at
it.  If it's enabling automatic /CS managment that doesn't sound like
something we can actually use in Linux based on the comment.

There is no need for this to be a function - there is one caller and
it contains only a single function.  Just inline it and add a comment if
there is a need for documentation.  This applies to quite a lot of the
functions in this file, they are very small and have only one user so
mostly just make the code less direct.  Using spi_ as the prefix also
has a namespacing issue, that's the namespace for the core.

This is trying to munge a numeric return code into a pointer without
using PTR_ERR() and friends which is ugly and fragile.  If you really
need to do this use the standard macros, but since we already have an
error code in the message you can use that (though it seems nothing
actually ever reads these...).  You should also use real error codes not
magic numbers.

This is racy, you are completing the transfer then disabling the
interrupts.  Something could come along and try and do another transfer
before the interrupts are disabled.

There's nothing in this case that checks that the interrupt actually
fired.

It seems there's no interrupt masking in the actual IP and the
interrupts will scream when the IP is idle?

Don't open code GPIO chip selects, use the core support.

Taking the spinlock here looks completely pointless - what is it
intended to protect?

-ENOMEM looks completely random here, please use a sensible error code
(if you got one back from another funtion pass it through).

Just use the transfer, the core will ensure that it is set.

This seems like a very large section of code to hold a spinlock for and
I'm not immediately seeing a reason why the locking has to be so
aggressive.  Among other things it's holding a spinlock with interrupts
disabled for up to two seconds over a polling transfer which is at best
needless.

Don't open code message parsing, use the core support and implement
transfer_one().

No error checking.  It'd also be better to have runtime power management
of this.

This has DT support but the DT binding is not documented.  Documentation
is mandatory for all new DT bindings.

This looks like it's duplicating something that should be in the clock
bindings.  As far as I can tell we never change the parent clock rate so
we can just look at that to identify the maximum clock rate.

Why not just handle the DT binding information being missing?
