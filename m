Hello,
   
I am using a Galileo Board with a RM 7000 MIPS processor. I have connected a Linux box to the board and set up a Cross-Compiler for Linux-MIPS (gcc). How do I access the serial port and print a string to the Hyperterminal on a Win NT machine which is also connected to the board. If someone could reply ASAP, please. If u can suggest any websites which contain such info. Thanks in advance.

Domcan
