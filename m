Yes please.

Correct. Guest to host communication either uses instructions which
imply a memory barrier or QDIO which uses atomics.

Mostly historical, s390 actually is one of the easiest architectures in
regard to memory barriers.

This has been introduced with git commit 5402ea6af11dc5a9, the smp_mb
and smp_mb__before_atomic are used in clear_bit_unlock and
__clear_bit_unlock which are 1:1 copies from the code in
include/asm-generic/bitops/lock.h. Only test_and_set_bit_lock differs
from the generic implementation.

That smp_mb can be removed. The initial s390 vdso code is heavily influenced
by the powerpc version which does have a smp_wmb in vdso_init right before
the vdso_ready=1 assignment. s390 has no need for that.

This one does not make sense to me. Imho can be removed as well.

s390 just uses the compare-and-swap instruction for the basic lock/unlock
operation, this implies the memory barrier. We do call the hypervisor for
contended locks if the lock can not be acquired after a number of retries.

A while ago we did play with ticket spinlocks but they behaved badly in
out usual virtualized environments. If we find the time we might take a
closer look at the para-virtualized queued spinlocks.

Correct, this is the update count mechanics with the vdso user space code.

Got it, makes sense.
