The interrupt occurs *before* the device de-asserts BUSY.  A small pause 
is needed to allow the device to clear BUSY and allow libata to function 
normally.

Calling ata_sff_host_intr() while BUSY is asserted causes the driver to 
fail, as it is expecting to be called from a true IDE interrupt routine. 
  Delaying calling ata_sff_host_intr() until BUSY is clear (using the 
tasklet) seemed to be the cleanest way to write the driver given that we 
are using an interrupt generated by DMA complete.
