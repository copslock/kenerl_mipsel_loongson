There was this[1] posted.

The main problem is the only way we know to instantiate a serdev ctrlr
is if there's a slave device described. I did make a series[2] that
makes serdev and tty device co-exist. Then you can more easily
manually attach a device. The problems are you get mismatches in
opens/closes in the tty layer and what should the behavior be if
userspace is trying to access the same port via both the tty and
serdev. After breaking things last time I touched tty open and close,
I'm hesitant to do that again. :)

There's been some discussions but no real progress. I think we need to
be able to support multiple DT roots and then assign/apply DTs to
arbitrary devices. That's first going to require that of_root is not
exposed outside of drivers/of/ and then there could be some issues
with assuming root==NULL is the base of the single DT. Beyond that, I
haven't given it too much thought.

An alternative is we create DT nodes for all devices which don't have
them (or only certain buses) and then we can apply overlays. This is
kind of headed down the path of doing an OpenFirmware implementation
which would enumerate all the devices and pass that DT to the OS.
