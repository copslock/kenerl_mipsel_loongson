Hi, all,

I just port mipsel linux 2.2.12 to our hardware
evaluation board. I want to modify a module
to a character device driver. But I do not know
how to do and which files to update. 
Can mipsel linux support module? If so, which rpm
do I have to download and where can I find them?
If not, how can I  change a module to a character 
device driver?
If someone knows, please help me.

Thanks in advance!

Barry
