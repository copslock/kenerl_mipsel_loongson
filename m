Has anyone managed to get Linux (any distribution) onto the Visual
Workstation? Personally, had a no. of problems
with the Visual Workstation and my last gasp effort to use the machine
(apart from as a dust magnet) is to run Linux on
them .... any info. pls. let me know. (linux.sgi.com ... used to have a
couple of pages as I recall, but dont think they are there now....)


rgds & thnks,


Michael L
