there are au1000_usbraw.c and au1000_usbtty.c in linux-mips.org's CVS
under drivers/char.

I'd be excited to see usb storage driver for usb device.

as a related topic, does anyone know how usb gadget api is coming? I'm
assuming that once usb gadget stabilized and people start using it,
we'll be converting au1's usb dev driver to gadget api, no?

or people already working on it?
