Watch your words.

The Reality series are using upto about a dozen i860s in the gfx pipeline.
XZ and Impact is a relativly simple gfx in comparison - I'm told there is
about a dozen different graphics platforms that share nothing but the
basic architecture and all are marketed as XZ.  I just hope that isn't
true ...
