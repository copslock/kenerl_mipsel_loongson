But do_initcalls() is called by kernel_init(), this is the init process which is
going to exec /sbin/init later.

But this doesn't really matter,

Yes, yes, this doesn't really matter. We can even add set(TIF_NOHZ) at the start
of start_kernel(). The question is, I still can't understand why do we want to
have the global TIF_NOHZ.

Ah, you probably meant that we can kill context_tracking_task_switch() as
we discussed.

But I meant another thing, TIF_NOHZ is already global because it is always
set after context_tracking_cpu_set().

Performance-wise, this set/clear code above can be better because it avoids
the slow paths on the untracked CPU's. But let's ignore this, the question is
why the change above is not correct? Or why it can make the things worse?

And in this case a) user_enter() is pointless on CPU_0, and b) CPU_1 misses
the necessary user_enter().

Sure. And this can happen anyway? Why the change in __context_tracking_task_switch()
is wrong?

I see. Again, does the global TIF_NOHZ really help?

See above. This depends, but forcing the slow paths on all CPU's can be more
costly.

I am lost too ;) Didn't we already discuss this? A task calls user_exit() on
CPU_0 for no reason, migrates to the tracked CPU_1 and finally returns to user
space leaving this cpu in IN_KERNEL state?

OK, thanks, so in this case we miss user_enter().

But again, we can miss it anyway if preemptions comes before "exception" ?
if CPU 1 was in IN_KERNEL state.
