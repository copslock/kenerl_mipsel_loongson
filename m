Hi,

  I am trying to install HardHat linux on an "Indy r5000", the SCSI disk
was blank and I was running into problems so I did a mkfs on it.  Now
the install script keeps asking me to initalize the drive.  I do not
have access to an Irix machine to repartation it or anything of the
such.  Any ideas?
