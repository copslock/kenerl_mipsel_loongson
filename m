Two questions:

Does this mean that you are going to be posting the hardware specifications
for the Indigo 2, O2, etc.. (i.e. SGI's more recent systems) on your web
server for public access, or will this information be disseminated through
controlled channels?

Also,  if you are going to post the specs - when will they be available?

Just curious, since HP publicly released some detailed hardware specs for
their systems in PDF format to assist their Linux porting project - it's very
nice.

Thanks
