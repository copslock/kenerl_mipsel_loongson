I can't.  The dtb is already programmed into the bootloader ROMs, 
changing the kernel code will not change that.  It is fait accompli.

In theory yes.  However:

1) The chip designers will not change it.

2) There will likely be no more designs with either CIU or CIU2, so we 
know what all the different possibilities are today.

When CIU3 is deployed, we will use the lessons we have learned to do 
things the Right Way.

Agreed that it could be in the DTS, and retrospect it probably should 
have been put in the DTS, but it wasn't.  So I think what we have now is 
a workable solution, and has the added attraction of working with 
already deployed boards.
