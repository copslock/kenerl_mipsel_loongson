* I realize this comes off as fairly negative, but I'm just trying to explain
the
* issues involved once gfx gets added to the mix.  There would need to be a
* buy-in at a very high level of SGI mgmt. before we could start making the
* hardware details of our graphics subsystems available (at least the more
modern
* ones, such as O2, Impact, etc.).

I don't think this is being negitive, it might not be what we want to hear, but
at least someone who knows about our underlying hardware is making comments.

Probably the first thing to do would be to get the go ahead for a proof of
concept only (under NDA) probably using an old indy. If this proves impossible
from either the technical or political pov's then we need to re-think.

I personaly don't think we have much chance unless we go to NDA and even then
its going to be really hard to get buy-in.
