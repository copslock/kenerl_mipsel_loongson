Hi all;

I am wondering - is anyone at SGI doing any work to get docs for the Indigo2
Video hardware together?  I know the docs aren't in a publishable format in some
cases, but I was just wondering if anyone is making an effort to get some
information about the video hardware out.  I just got an Indigo2 w/High impact, and I
was hoping to play some with a driver for XFree86.

Thanks for any info,
Erik
