HELP!

Does somebody have a sort of a 'cookbook' on how to install
Linux (HardHat 5.1??) on an Indy and also information on
how to get the X-server (4.0.1??) running on an Indy?

I have installed the oss.sgi.com HardHat 5.1 distribution
on an Indy R4K system with basic graphics (8-bit), but
I cannot seem to get the X-server working...

There must be someone who has an Indy -with- an Xserver
(at least the person who ported the X-server to the Indy
I guess.... :)

Any help appreciated!

Regards,
Geert-Albert
