Too bad, we might have used a ton of them running Linux for the Clown
project, see www.ccnacht.de and slashdot.org.  Friends of Realvideo and
raytraced anymations will get on their cost :-)

For those who still don't know, this night Linux made more Linux history.
We've assembled a cluster of 530 Linux nodes in less than 24h plus additional
administration and server machines.  A large fraction of the machines was
loaned by volunteers.  Problems solved by the cluster include computing
animations, scientific and mathematical problems that were taking advantage
of the large available memory space, computational power and fail safe
features - we're continuing to compute while we're already disassembling parts
of the cluster.  The most important benchmark ran was Linpack which was only
run on the 50 666MHz 21164 Alphas which at this time is still running since
the rest of the cluster was busy with other jobs.  Results will be filed for
an entry in the top 500 list.

The price for the sickest idea to use the cluster goes to the cluster version
of a MIDI player using the PCspeaker which right now is playing random sounds
on all Intel machines ...
