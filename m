Hello,

I know this has got to be a FAQ of some sort, but I can't find
the answer (and I _have_ looked everywhere!): How do I go about
installing Linux on my Indy? Does it have to co-exist w/ IRIX?

Please point me to any document offering step-by-step instructions
(if that exists).

Regards,
Richard Duran
