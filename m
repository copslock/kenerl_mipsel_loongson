Have a look at www.linux-mips.org. You can find some documentation
there, along with links to various base system which you can use as
a starting point. There's no "ready to install" distribution for
linux/mips yet, although the debian mips port is currently making big
steps forward...and yes, it can easily coexist with Irix.
