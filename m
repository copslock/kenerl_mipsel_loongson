Hi Dan,

Thanks for your reply.

>>>> Where did you get the kernel?

I'm sorry that the kernel is 2.4.22(linux-14oct2003.tar).

>>>>> What patches did you apply?  Were there any errors?

Applied a patch(pb1550.patch) got from one of my colleague.
I had made the following modifications to get the build through.
Initially, the FLASH_LOAD_ADDR was 0xBFD00000 and the --adjust-vma address was 0x3ed00000. I modified them to 0xBF000000 and 0x3e000000, as it was in 2.4.21-pre4(I used this with Au1500 eval board). With the previous address, the tftp load was not starting with the error message "Flash device failure". After this modification, the loading the image is through.

Also I modified,
the zboot/Makefile to build PB1xxx.
ifdef CONFIG_MIPS_PB1550
        $(MAKE) -C pb1xxx $@
endif

the zboot/pb1xxx/Makefile to set the board name.
ifdef CONFIG_MIPS_PB1550
BNAME=pb1550
endif

>>>> What version of the compiler is this?

gcc version 3.3.2 20031022 (Red Hat Linux 3.3.2-1)

>>>>> What commands did you use to build the kernel and S-record image?

I used make zImage.flash. It uses

zImage.flash: zImage
        $(OBJCOPY) -O srec --adjust-vma 0x3e000000 \
                ../images/zImage.$(BNAME) ../images/$(BNAME).flash.srec

OBJCOPY=mips_fp_le-objcopy

Please find below the .config file content.

Thanks,
Xavier.
