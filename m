Are there specific loops in the kernel whose conditions are controlled
by READ_ONCE() that don't contain cpu_relax(), smp_mb(), etc.?  One
way to find them given your description of your hardware is to make
cpu_relax() be smp_mb() as Peter suggests, and then run tests to find
the problems.

Or have you already done this?
