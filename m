I have about 50 of these.  They are missing the drives (floppy, hard, CD)
and RAM but are ready to go otherwise (cables, Jazz364, etc.).  They've been
moth-balled for a few years but I'm sure they're fine.  I've yet to install
Linux on any of them but WinNT ran fine on a few for years.  Anyone
interested?
