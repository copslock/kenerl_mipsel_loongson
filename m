: MIPS Chips != SGI systems.  My question still stands.

Have you forgotten Nintendo 64 sales?

MIPS Chips == $$$ for SGI.  $$$ for SGI is what it is all about, that's what
feeds the light bills.   If making a bunch of hackers happy turns into $$$
for SGI in the long term, then we do it.  At this point, I believe it is 
obvious that that is the case.
