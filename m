I've checked out HEAD of the linux-mips CVS linux/ module (2.6.12-rc3) and
my resulting kernel will not boot on my BCM91250E (Sentosa) board.  Here
is what I get when I attempt to boot it from CFE:

I found the general area of address '801d763c' in System.map, and it
appears to fail in the xicor code -- xicor_read() I think, when probing to
see if the real-time clock device exists.  There is indeed one of these on
the board, i.e.,

ARTIS> show devices
Device Name          Description
-------------------  ---------------------------------------------------------
[... snip ...]
clock0               Xicor X1241 RTC on SMBus channel 1

For what it's worth, Linux 2.4.30 boots and works on the same board.  I
also tried 2.6.11.7 from kernel.org and it failed in the same manner as
shown above.  I tried disabling some options, like SMP, to no avail.

Any suggestions?  Is it possible I need to flash-upgrade the CFE firmware?
