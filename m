I've managed to procure a temporary Indy at work now, so I should be
able to start hacking on EFS again early next week.  I actually have
better support already than that kernel would indicate, but I haven't
committed all of the changes yet (I don't think).

I'll clean up my current support tomorrow or Friday, and then I'll
check it in and coerce Miguel or Ralf into making a new test kernel
available.
