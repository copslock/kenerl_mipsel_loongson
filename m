2.1.121 is over two years old and is missing several mips patches.
There is no good reason to use 2.1.121, modutils 2.3 is backwards
compatible.

The last mips specific patch was in modutils 2.3.15.  2.3.18 ignores
empty relocate sections which I believe were a problem for several
architectures, possibly including mips.  2.3.19 will be released this
weekend and includes a mips patch to fix a minor problem which I doubt
anybody has ever hit.  If you need modutils now, use 2.3.18, if you can
wait 48 hours, wait for 2.3.19.
