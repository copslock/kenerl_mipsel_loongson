This is not linux specific, but I'm hoping someone will have a
suggestion.  I recently got an Indigo2 r8000.  Anything I hook up to the
external chain is flakey.  It won't always boot (complains about cable
disk or cdrom error), and I get regular scsi timeouts.  Does anyone have
suggestions how to fix this?
	Thanks
