Hi folks!

There probably already were numerous threads concerning this subject, but
I'm new and I didn't find anything fitting in the archives. So here is my
question.

Anyone who did or tried a Linux port for O2, or contributed anything
regarding that topic, could you please give me that information again. At
the moment I try to gather as much info as possible in this regard, as we
have some O2s running IRIX 6.3 and gathering dust most of the time.

Any help appreciated.

Markus
