Which we do

btw originally, this also cleared the UME bit. Could this be what made
the difference on the JZ4780 ?

Can you try this patch on the JZ4780 , just out of curiosity ?

I'd suppose this is OK, since clearing a disabled FIFO makes no sense ?

If it's not enabled, do you need to clear it ?

Hence my question above, do you need to clear the FIFO even if it was
not enabled ?

It is well possible, but I'd like to understand what really happens
here, not just guess.

In that case, that needs to be fixed. But serial8250_clear_fifos()
should only do what the name says -- clear FIFOs -- not disable them.

Linux sets the FCR[2:1] if the FIFO is enabled even now.

The UME bit is in the FCR, serial8250_clear_fifos() originally cleared
it, cfr:
-               serial_out(p, UART_FCR, 0);
in f6aa5beb45be27968a4df90176ca36dfc4363d37 . So the code was originally
completely disabling the UART on JZ4780 .
