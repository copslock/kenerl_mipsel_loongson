This would mean that before your patch in oct of 2012, Loongson and Octeon 
were not reserving the IO space for i8042.

The only information I have is the comment before request_region in i8042-io.h that
touching data register on some platforms is flaky.  If your patch was primarily aimed at
addressing the error message from release_region, the current patch I uploaded should
also take care of it too.
