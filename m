I have a feeling that someone hasn't any chance to port Linux in the O2 or
Indigo2 platform unless Sillicon Graphics wants too. In other words, by
giving a great deal of information in public for building the appropriate
drivers. Am I wrong about it ?

By the way, SGI has officialy report to support Linux on visual
workstations. Any ideas if they will also transfer the desktop enviroment
commonly used in IRIX ? This seems to me very likely, in regards of
providing a common user interface both in IRIX based systems and Linux
based systems provided by SGI. That could be a great benefeat of the Linux
community..

Personally I haven't find any Linux user interface more nicely crafted
than SGI's 4DWM.
