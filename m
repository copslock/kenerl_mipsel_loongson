Well, I could done that. I have only one programming project right now and
this isn't even programming, just writing a FAQ and updating a homepage. 
There are still some reasons why I can't help you with this right now: 

1. I know almost nothing about MIPS/Linux. Well, as soon as it boots for
   me will I study all its advantages and disadvantages.
2. My internet connection is not very fast. Only modem at home. Well, I
   have a faster connection at school, but you know. Serving a ftp
   with 10mb kernels is not a job for me. (well, I may take charge of the
   www site some day in the (near?) future).

Developing MIPS/Linux or developing something else?
How many MIPS/Linux are there right now? 10? 50? 100?

How many coders are there for MIPS/Linux, just Ralf?

As I said I have to install the funky shit first of all. :-)
