(No, not yet...)

The client build team has asked me to set up a Linux/Indy system for
them to do some preliminary porting work on, so I'd like to make sure
that we don't spend time working around previously-fixed bugs.  Do
people have patches (especiall libc patches!) lying around that they can
offer up?  Better still would be actual binaries, etc., but this beggar
won't be a chooser!

Mike
