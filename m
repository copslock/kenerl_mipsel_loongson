What is the current link to your repository? The original one from Lemote
is now a 404, and the GitHub one has been "archived".

You cannot bisect it. Because I've tried it for 24 hours without sleep, but
failed. ;-)

We've just identified and confirmed the source of the shutdown problem a
few days ago on this mailing list. It's related to a PREEMPT race condition
in the cpufreq framework that triggers a timing-dependent, probabilistic
lockup in the i8259 PIC driver. And it was first noticed by Ville Syrj=E4l=
=E4
on a x86 system, my debugging rediscovered his findings.

You can read the full investigation at here:
https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/11/13/857

You can pick up the patch from:
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20190207205812.GA11315@darkstar.musicnaut.iki.=
fi/

A patch has been authored and submitted by Aaro Koskinen, but currently it
seems stuck in the mailing list because the maintainer worries about regres=
sion
and asks for testing on more MIPS systems, although we believe it's a trivi=
al
patch.

In addition, I've discovered and fixed another bug preventing the machine f=
rom
shutting down, this patch has already merged into the Linus tree.

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?=
id=3D8a96669d77897ff3613157bf43f875739205d66d

The mainline framebuffer driver doesn't have any hardware drawing, printing
even a single line on the console is required a full screen redraw via memo=
ry-
mapped I/O over the slow PCI interface. I have rebased the 2D acceleration
code against the latest upstream driver and sent the patch to the fbdev mai=
ling
list on February 2nd.=20

But the maintainers seem to be working on other tasks and the patches (incl=
uding
mine and others') on the list didn't receive any response.

It's avaliable from

I'll continue working on upstreaming these out-of-tree drivers as my person=
al
project. I hope you'll be able to use a fully-functional machine with the m=
ainline
kernel soon, my current target is Linux 5.3.
