http://www.acheron-design.com/windowmaker.org-new/  <--that's the kind
of thing I was thinking largo could do for ya, just set it up, and let

http://wm.current.nu/
his site.

If you want him to do a layout for the linux-mips page, just let me or
him (largo@current.nu) know, and we can get it set up (layout and
graphics), and all you will have to do is provide some content and
update the news and such through web interface.
