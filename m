    Sigh. Do you know that Au1100 also has the same MMC controllers? The 
platform device is not registered in this case though and the driver (however 
small it now actually uses the platform device per se) is therefore unable to 
control it (well, I'm not sure it can do that since it seems to be Au1200 
centered now (using DBDMA), however it was initially written for Au1100 as it 
seems.

    I'm sure that can be handled without moving the device itself...

    Hm, why would there be any if au1xxx.h resolves the right board #include?

    I really don't know -- never seen such trick before.

    Yes, this indeed looks better.

    I've just posted a patch to fix this in the current code. Well, not that 
it matters much but I'm kind of pedantic. :-)

    Humm, the DBDMA code seems to mean by "DMA channel" something different, 
see au1xxx_dbdma_chan_alloc()...

    I'd definitely prefer to leave the SOC device where they were...

    Good point.  I think that the code in arch/mips/au1000/common/platform.c 
should check the sys_pinfunc register, and not blindly register all devices.

    Indeed...
