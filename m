Joe,

 Just a quick update.

 So more weirdly even that's actually a TNC connector rather than a type F 
one.  I've got a suitable TNC->BNC adapter now (although regrettably such 
adapters seem to be available as 50Ù parts only; hopefully any distortion 
won't be too significant or maybe my digital monitor will even be able to 
compensate it, but at £1.76 (~$2.64) per item it's certainly worth trying 
before resorting to the original DEC TNC->BNC cable still apparently 
available from second-hand part suppliers at ~£80/$120 per a mere 1ft 
part) and a BNC->DE-15 cable is on the way.

 So I think I've got all the basic stuff covered now, including a change 
similar to your proposal as well as a conversion to the driver model/new 
TURBOchannel support infrastructure.  But what I remembered is actually 
right, the issue is wiring hardware cursor support into fbcon.  The driver 
uses its own display_switch structure with its own aafbcon_cursor handler 
to use the twin onboard Bt431 chips for cursor generation (there's also 
aafbcon_set_font that pokes at the Bt431s for cursor dimension changes).  
I need to figure out what the best way will be to make the fbcon subsystem 
support such an arrangement and that'll take me a little bit yet, so 
please be patient.

 Note that the board is weird enough to have a 1-bit (true monochrome) 
graphics plane, however the Bt455 used by the MX graphics adapter for 
screen image generation is a 4-bit grey-scale video RAMDAC (only the LSB 
inputs of its pixel port are wired to the graphics plane) and the twin 
Bt431s use the overlay plane to produce a 2-bit grey-scale cursor.  So we 
do want to use the hardware cursor to be able to make it prominent among 
the characters displayed throughout the screen and a software-generated 
cursor cannot really substitute what hardware provides.
