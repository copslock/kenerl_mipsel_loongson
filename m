OK, wher are the non customer RPMS for big endian MIPS/noarch i.e. things
like initfiles, inetd etc...

I think my install is going to fly I just need to find the packages I'm
missing. I think I may look through my install procedure and see if I
can come up witha minimal list of RPMS that install without conflicts...
