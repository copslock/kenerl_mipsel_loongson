Actually I think there is a lot that can be negotiated.  In one of my
previous postings I've already gone a bit into this.  Some people at
SGI are *alot* more Linux-friendly than you think.  Furthermore given the
fact that way more UNIX systems run Linux than anything else definately
has impressed a couple of people in the higher levels at SGI.

Given that the way the Free Software comunity and the world of the
proprietary software think is radically different we have to accept
that a big company like SGI doesn't take make the way from proprietary
software to Free Software in one big jump.  Between black and white
there is grey ...

And after all - resistance is futile.  "You can't outrun Penguin from
Borg.  You can't destroy him.  If you damage him, the essence of what
he is remains ...  he regenerates and keeps coming.  Eventually you'll
weaken.  Your reserves will be gone.  His is relentless"
