Could you precise the question a bit more?
Which JTAG-probe are you using and which software for it?
Do you have a schematic layout and datasheet?

Since this list is for Linux, you should be surprised if you get some
more help.
As well the format doesn't matter as long as your JTAG-software is
able to handle it, myself I prefer Motorola SREC.
