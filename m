Ah!  That's my point.  As a company, the hardware is valued but the
software isn't.  Just because we *give* software with our hardware
doesn't mean that we are a software oriented company.  We are
definitely hardware oriented.

I've been arguing the point that software is as much of value as
hardware for years.  Look at Bill Gates!  He didn't make it by selling
hardware.  Unfortunately, I've finally succumbed to the realization
that SGI is a hardware company first.

So, if one wants to make any points to upper management, it has to be
in terms of "how much hardware are we going to sell?"  If developing a
really powerful *free* operating system, such as Linux, will sell lots
of boxes, you can bet upper management will be interested.
