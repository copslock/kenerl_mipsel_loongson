11 September 1973 was Allende assassinated....

How many children from Vietnam, Irak, Iran, Belgrad...died?

Nobody cried, no minute of silence....

Are USA GOOD and the other ones BAD?

Who can say something like that?

We are just in Power and Oil interested, maybe letting these countries in
peace will help much more than a new war....

Send thid message further.
