I've noticed in the Hard Hat 5.1 and the Simple Linux distros that GDB is
lacking.  Is there a reason for that?  This is not a complaint, but more
an iquiry to find out if there's known problems before I go banging my
head against the wall trying to build something that won't for some
reason or the other.

I'm presently using egcs-1.1.2, binutils 2.9.5, BFD 000425, and
glibc-2.0.6 from Simple Linux 0.1 on an Indy.

Would appreciate any tips/tricks/caveats beforehand.

Thanks!
