The 3.0 supplement is 32-bit only, I need the 64-bit.

Are they 64-bit? If so, please send 3.1 and the PSG 1.2.2. and once the
oss is up perhaps someone can place them there.
I have recieved a few "me too" requests so placeing them there would
be a benifit to all.

yeah, but only the the 3.0 supplement (32-bit)

I will look there, though it still seems to be down.
