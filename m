I didn't notice the missing branch to restore_all in that first commit -
that makes (more) sense now.

No actual reason there, I most likely deleted the branch, looked around,
saw the "j restore_all" in @resume_userspace and went for that (shoddy
I know...)

Makes total sense, thanks for the detailed reasoning!

Right, that's even better, I'll send a v2 with that.
