Hello All,

I was recently hired by RMI Corporation, the owners of Alchemy, to work
on Linux updates and maintenance.  While I have worked with Linux at
this and other companies for several years, this is my first kernel
patch.  Please send me any feedback you have on it as it certainly won't
be my last.

Thanks.
-Kevin
