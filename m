That's yet another type of machine.  I've ported Linux to the SNI RM200C;
it should also run on the RM300.  The R400 is a SMP machine and I don't
have any data about it at all.  In fact, since so far nobody was so
generous to loan me a SMP box there isn't even MIPS SMP yet ...

But here is what _you_ can do: Call SNI and have a bit fun nervragging them
for Linux.  There are so many very different MIPS machines out there that
reverse engineering isn't a real option unless you solve the problem of
human immortability before :-(
