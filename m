Hi,

I wish I could but it's been years since I worked on that project and I'm pretty 
sure that I don't have any hardware around anymore, but I will do a thorough 
search next week anyway. There may be something hiding in the back of a dusty 
closet that I've forgotten about, if I find something I will let you know.

Cheers,
Charles
