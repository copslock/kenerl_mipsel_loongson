Hello:

I have several Personal Iris' (from 4D/20's with entry graphics and 8 =
meg up to 4D/35's with Turbo Graphics with 104 meg) and would love to =
play with Linux on them.  I am using Linux now (red Hat 6.0) on an Intel =
box but the tought of putting it on one (or more) of my Iris' is very =
intriguing.  I realize that SGI has long since dropped support for these =
boxes but since I am the proud owner of 10 of them I would love to see =
this new OS ported to them.  I am also willing to help.  I am located =
just outside of guelph Ontario Canada.  If anyone has any info about =
this please let me know.

thanks
Chuck
