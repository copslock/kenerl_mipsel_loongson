Ok let me explain the difference.

Current approach:

    ------------
    register_for_each_vma() / uprobe_mmap()
      install_breakpoint()
        uprobe_write_opcode() {
                if (instruction is not already patched) {
                        /* Gets called only _once_. */
                        increment the reference counter;
                        patch the instruction;
                }
        }
    ------------

Here, reference counter is updated only if we are going to patch the
instruction. No matter how many consumers are there, no matter how many
times install_breakpoint() gets called. Same case for decrement as well.
Reference counter will get decremented only when we are going to reset
the instruction.

Now, if I put it inside install_breakpoint():

    ------------
    uprobe_register()
      register_for_each_vma()
        install_breakpoint() {
                /* Called _for each consumer_ */
                increment the reference counter _once_;
                uprobe_write_opcode()
		...
        }

  OR

    uprobe_mmap()
      install_breakpoint() {
                increment the reference counter _for each consumer_;
                uprobe_write_opcode()
		...
      }
    ------------

By putting it inside install_breaopoint() / remove_breakpoint(), we
increment and decremnet the counter for each consumer.

Consider this python example:

    ------------
    # readelf -n /usr/lib64/libpython2.7.so.1.0 | grep -A2 Provider
      Provider: python
      Name: function__entry
      ... Semaphore: 0x00000000002899d8

    # sudo perf probe sdt_python:function__entry

    # strace python
      mmap(NULL, 2738968, PROT_READ|PROT_EXEC, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_DENYWRITE, 3, 0) = 0x7fff92460000
      mmap(0x7fff926a0000, 327680, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_FIXED|MAP_DENYWRITE, 3, 0x230000) = 0x7fff926a0000
      mprotect(0x7fff926a0000, 65536, PROT_READ) = 0
    ------------

The first mmap() maps the whole library into one region. Second mmap()
and third mprotect() split out the whole region into smaller vmas and
sets appropriate protection flags.

Now, in this case, install_breakpoint() will update reference counter
twice -- by second mmap() call and by third mprotect() call -- because
both regions contains the same reference counter. But, remove_brekpoint()
will decrement the reference counter only once, which will left counter
greater than 0 even when no one is tracing on that uprobe.

To solve this issue, I have to re-introduced sdt_mm_list, a list of
{consumer,mm} tuple for each uprobe. This tells us, for X consumer
we already have incremented the counter in Y mm so that we don't
increment same counter again. This additional complexity is to make
sure increment and decrement happen in sync.

Fortunately, we don't need to maintain this list with current approach,
because we know for sure that, increment and decrement will happen only
once when we patch/up-patch the instruction.

In short, if I put it inside install_breakpoint()/remove_breakpoint(),
I'll have to put the same logic there with more complication to
increment / decrement counter for each consumer. And additionally,
I've to maintain sdt_mm_list to make sure increment and decrement
happen in sync. With current approach, this all happens by default :)

Yes, I meant uprobe.

I don't think we can assume anything here because this is all in user's
control. User can even manually go and update the counter by directly
hooking into the memory. Ex, Brendan Gregg's blog on USDT explains how
to change counter manually in "Hacking with Ftrace: Is-Enabled" section
of his blog:
  http://www.brendangregg.com/blog/2015-07-03/hacking-linux-usdt-ftrace.html

Sure, let me know if you have any better idea.
