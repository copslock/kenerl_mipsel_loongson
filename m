I agree that reference counter is a consumer property and that was the
main reason my initial draft was to change trace_uprobe. But there were
couple of issues with that approach too. I've already mentioned few of
them here: https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/6/6/129. Apart from these, if I
do it inside trace_uprobe, kernel module won't have a way to use
reference counter.

Now about adding ref_ctr_offset into uprobe_consumer. Actually, I
didn't want to change the uprobe_consumer definition because it's
already exported and tools like systemtap are using it. And thus, I
haven't explored how difficult or easy it will be to implement it that
way.

I agree. We will loose the freedom to change stuff by exporting uprobe.

Hmm, how about this ...

  set_swbp(arch_uprobe, ...) {
    uprobe_write_opcode(arch_uprobe, ...) {
      uprobe = container_of(arch_uprobe);
      ...
    }
  }

Let me think on this. If this works, I won't need to export struct uprobe
outside.

I agree.

Quite possible. I need to explore on that.

That's correct.
