Thanks for looking at the patch and commenting.

I've taken a second look. I still have no way at all to test this, so 
please take a close look before potentially applying it, but how does this 
look to you?


Don't dereference pbuffer before ttesting it for null.
Don't do pointless check of pointer passed to vfree for null as vfree does 
this itself.
