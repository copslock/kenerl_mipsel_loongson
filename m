Another note from Richard Stallman in response to a comment I made about
how we are talking about getting SGI to provide *some* of our accelleration
source.

SGI releasing some free software would set a good example.  We might
want to write about it in the GNU's Bulletin or otherwise publicize
it.

If there is anything I can do to encourage matters, or solve any problems,
or clear up any possible misunderstandings, please let me know.


Meanwhile, I hope you'll encourage various people there to take a look
at http://www.gnu.ai.mit.edu/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html.
