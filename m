I am, yes, sitting on the edge of my seat for Mike to get the network
working so I can have access to the machine.  Mike's working on the
network now to stop my endless pestering.

The priority will be getting rpm itself to compile properly, although I
don't anticipate any huge problems.  I just need to tell it that
Linux/mips exists, I suspect.

There's a large lump of joy in knowing that gcc/libc etc work properly.
The rest is easy.

I suspect if we do a good enough job of porting the bulk of the RPMS that
RedHat will take the effort seriously.  There'll be a lot of RPMs to port,
though...
