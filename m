Hi,

We made changes to linux/MIPS kernel 2.2.1 for our
system and it's been running well so far. We now
plan to upgrade the kernel to 2.4.X. The question
we have is:

Which sub release of 2.4 is more stable and is
recommended to use? 

>From http://oss.sgi.com/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/linux,
I can see available tags for kernel 2.4 are:
linux_2_4_4, linux_2_4_3, linux_2_4_2,
linux_2_4_0...

Thanks in advance for your advice!

-Hua
