I have an O2 at home and I can help with testing (I am very good at picking up
problems) since I don't have much time for development. I also have 10 Indys at
work waiting for me to have some time to do something with them, possibly a
Linux cluster to play with "PAPERS" (http://www.aggregate.org) ...

I am new to the list (since about month ago), but due to lack of time I have
not read it much and have a backlog of about 600 messages ;-)

I keep mentioning that I don't have time, well, for Linux on the O2 I am wiling
to steal 2 hours from my sleep to work on it ;-)
