Yep sure, I'll just make it less crap first.

Obviously.

It'd also be good to hear from DaveM, sparc is the platform with the
strongest link to real OF AFAIK, so the of_() names make more sense
there.

Yep that sounds like a plan. I did it as a single header for starters so
I could autogenerate the rename script easily.

True, though a bigger impact to start with. I did that originally but
decided it might be better to start with the minimal patch to add the
new names. That way Linus might accept it this release, meaning we'd
have the new names in place for code in -next.

OK fair enough.

OK, I like it the way it is, but if the consensus is to change it then
we can. There's a bunch actually:

for_each_node_by_name(dn, name) \
for_each_node_by_type(dn, type) \
for_each_compatible_node(dn, type, compatible) \
for_each_matching_node(dn, matches) \
for_each_child_of_node(parent, child) \
for_each_node_with_property(dn, prop_name) \

So either dt_for_each_blah(), or for_each_dt_node_blah() ?

I'm not sure what you mean about global symbols.

I think it's fairly safe, in that direction, ie. defining the dt_*
names. Neither of those strings appears anywhere in the tree at the
moment (as a token).
