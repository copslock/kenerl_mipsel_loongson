Some bits of documentation are out on the WWW for MIPS R4000 boxes, but not
very technical - stuff like the 680MB CD-Rom users guide and ARC PROM commands
guide. I downloaded them from the Internet Technical Documentation Archive.

I also have some docs for the RC3x30 series - I'll mail the titles tommorrow
(if I remember to dig them out!), I was going to make them available to the
ITDA.
