: How many people buy the hardware and program the bare metal?

We own MIPS.  MIPS sold or licensed 19.2 million chips last year.  About
19 million of those were of the type "program the bare metal".

Much of the Linux/MIPS interest is for embedded systems.  We should have
done this years ago, there is no reason why not to do it other than NIH.
