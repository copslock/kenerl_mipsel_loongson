I've got a challenge S connected to the internet on a 34mbit connection,
running the (somewhat modificated) hardhat distribution.

I am more then willing to host the linux/SGI pages on this machine, and put
the machine up
for development if people are intrested.

I don't know if the www.linux.sgi.com machine is ever going to get back up,
but if it isn't,
this is maybe a solution?

Greetz,

Richard
