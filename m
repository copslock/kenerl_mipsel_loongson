Hi All

First post on this list as I have come over from xscale and x86 embedded linux designs to a potential MIPS design.

Does anyone know of any sources of information regarding linux on the TX4939 initially on the RBTX4939 development platform.

Any info would be gratefully received. I have done some searching for info on the TX4939 but info seems thin on the ground.

Many Thanks

Barry
