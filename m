Here I disagree. All of these things are completely universal, not
MIPS-specific.

I disagree with this, at least for the most part. If the kernel does
the fpu emulation correctly, there's no reason it shouldn't be
possible to run existing binaries on a hardened kernel that does not
even support executable stack.

Yes. Actually the simple way to implement this in userspace would be
with a page-sized, page-aligned object in TLS and a special call to
mprotect and your new syscall. One thing I'm not clear on: should this
memory have permissions r-x or rwx? If it has rwx, that defeats a lot
of the purpose of non-executable-stack. Hopefully it's r-x and the
kernel bypasses the non-writability to write to it.

Dynamic linking is completely a separate matter. Not all programs are
even dynamic-linked.

That's nice from a standpoint of avoiding memory waste, but it's
problematic if .////

I proposed a couple and I think they're much less ugly. Could you
point me to the others?

But perhaps you could clarify one thing for me: why is any of this
even needed? A delay slot only exists for branch instructions, and I
can't see any reason the kernel can't just emulate the branch
instruction at the same time. This is a very restricted class of
instructions that should not require any complex emulation of memory
permissions, just manipulation of the resulting program counter value
after the floating point instruction finishes. Or am I missing
something?

I wasn't even aware that it didn't until your email.
