TLV is a price of extensibility vs simplicity.
Say we have a syscall_foo(struct XX __user *x); that takes
struct XX {
  int flag;
  int var1;
};
now we want to add another variable to the structure that will be used
only when certain flag is set. You cannot do it easily without
breaking old user binaries, since new structure will be:
struct XX2 {
  int flag;
  int var1;
  int var2;
};
if we do copy_from_user(,, sizeof(struct XX2)) it will brake old programs.
Potentially we can do it the ugly way:
copy_from_user(,, sizeof(struct XX)), then check flag and do another
copy_from_user(,, sizeof(struct XX2)) just to fetch extra argument.
but then another day passes and yet another new flag means that both
var1 and var2 are unused and it needs 'u64 var3' instead.
Now kernel looks very ugly by doing multiple copy_from_user() of different
structures.
It would be much cleaner with nlattr:
syscall_foo(struct nlattr *attrs, int len);
kernel fetches 'len' bytes onces and then picks var[123] fields from nlattr
array. In other words nlattr array is a way to represent flexible structure
where fields can come and go in the future.
This was a simple example. Consider the case where var1 and var2
are arrays of things.
imo the old:
struct sock_fprog {
        unsigned short          len;    /* Number of filter blocks */
        struct sock_filter __user *filter;
};
is the example of inflexible user interface.
It could have been single 'struct nlattr'
nlattr->nla_len == length of filter program in bytes
nlattr->nla_type == ARRAY_OF_SOCK_FILTER constant
nla_data(nlattr) - variable length array of 'struct sock_filter' bpf
instructions.
Right now I'd like to extend it for the work I'm doing around eBPF, but
I cannot, since it's rigid. If it was TLV, I could have easily added new flags,
new types, new sections to bpf programs.
For user space it would have been just as easy to populate such
'struct nlattr' as to populate 'struct sock_fprog'.
