Well it's still something of a problem on powerpc. No one has
volunteered to test io_uring on powerpc, so at this stage it will go in
completely untested.

If there was a selftest in the tree I'd be a bit happier, because at
least then our CI would start testing it as soon as the syscalls were
wired up in linux-next.

And yeah obviously I should test it, but I don't have infinite time
unfortunately.

But that's the thing, if we just wire them up untested they may not
actually work. And then you have the far worse situation where the
syscall exists in kernel version x but does not actually work properly.

See the mess we have with pkeys for example.

For syscalls that have a selftest in the tree, and don't rely on
anything arch specific I agree.

I'm a bit more wary of things that are not easily tested and have the
potential to work differently across arches.
