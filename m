Hello,
     I've been using the kernel from linux-mips.org on my board with RM7000 
CPU for several month with no problem. I checked out a new copy from 
linux-mips.org recently and found the cache code had been rewritten all 
over the place, and the new file sc-rm7k.c cannot even compile. After a 
quick check on that file according to the error messages it seems that 
nobody has even tried to compile this file.

My question is: does the new cache code work with rm7k cpu now? or in the 
future? 
anybody tried that on rm7k with success?

Thanks in advance

-Michael
