I don't like this for multiple reasons.
1) There is a better patch posted which doesn't break the AM335x and
   clearly identifies and fixes the problem on the JZ4780 / CI20
2) The JZ4780 8250 core is not a standard 8250 core, since it has extra
   bits in the FCR register (like the UME bit, which disables the whole
   UART block), so the revert IMO would break that core too, it just
   hides the breakage. I'm still trying to understand the implications
   of that in detail, but the discussion wasn't quite constructive.

I'd much rather see Ezequiel's patch applied, since that's far less
destructive approach to fixing the problem than the revert.
