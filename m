:   A friend sent this to me, and I thought it was excellent.

:I bet he saw it on the gcc2 developers list... from me ;-)

It is an excellent piece.  The problem is that many will not
have the patience to read it since it is so long.

My internal "Why Linux/Freeware" web page at SGI has a pointer to
Eric Raymond's treatise (since David pointed it to me for which
I'm grateful).

To make it easier for more people to grasp I use to send
this short excerpt from the last part:

	No commercial developer can match the pool of talent the Linux
	community can bring to bear on a problem. Very few could afford
	even to hire the more than two hundred people who have contributed
	to fetchmail! [A freeware program maintained by Eric -- Ed] 

        Perhaps in the end the free-software culture will triumph not
	because cooperation is morally right or software "hoarding" is
	morally wrong (assuming you believe the latter, which neither
	Linus nor I do), but simply because the commercial world cannot
	win an evolutionary arms race with free-software communities that
	can put orders of magnitude more skilled time into a problem. 

We know this of course, now the big question is how to open the eyes
of our CEOs and high level managers (we're working on it).
