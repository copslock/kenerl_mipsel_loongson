Is the PCI slot supported on the o2 (i.e., could I put a linux
supported pci card in and use it)?  Also is the o2 AV IO board
supported?  Is that encompassed by VICE or is that separate?

What about the PCI slots on o200?  Are they supported?

Also, out of curiosity, is there a list somewhere of all the asics in
the Octane?  e.g., sound chip(s), ethernet, parallel/serial, etc.

Thanks,

Alex
