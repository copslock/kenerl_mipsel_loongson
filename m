Last time I checked the SRPM files for it where on CD#2. They arent the most
recent but are 4.2. I was thus somewhat suprised you mailed Erik. - BTW the
best person to mail in Red Hat isnt Erik he's generally far far too busy. Try
the support people. I normally ask Clarence Smith if I need to check something.
