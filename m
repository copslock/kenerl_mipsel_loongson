I'm glad you are still working on it!
Unfortunately it's really late right now and I'm leaving tomorrow
(well, today as we passed midnight) for the whole week :( I'm not sure
if I'll get a chance to review this, not to mention testing against
any of my PCIe card.

I wonder if you could write specs for that core, so I could write
GPL/any driver for it? Is that driver really big?
