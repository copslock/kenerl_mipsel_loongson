I noticed the previous poster mentioning that the Indy2 doesn't have X support yet under Linux. I'm wondering: does linux support for one machine get fully implemented and then tweaked to go to others, or is it a ground-up approach for each new machine in the port list?

Basically, I'm wondering how hard its going to be to take linux over to the O2 once the Indy stuff gets really done.

In that vein, I want linux for my O2 so badly (even just in a command-line configuration) that I'm thinking about trying to help. What are the major obstacles which need overcoming to get the current state of linux-mips to work on an O2?

TIA,
