Using 'mti' sounds like the right choice to me given both of those
points.

Ok. Could you try to place that into the property description?

Ok.

As a user I don't see why the DT author should be in charge of whether
my UART gets higher priority than my I2C controller. That priority is
not a fixed property of the interrupt (as the line and flags are).

That said, this is a grey area. Are there any cases where this
prioritisation is critical on existing devices?

My point is that the wording implies that the third cell is optional on
a per-interrupt basis, when in reality it depends on the GIC node's
#interrupt-cells and affect all devices with GIC interrupts.

If &gic/#interrupt-cells = <3>, the third cell can't be absent.

If &gic/interrupt-cells = <2>, the third cell can't be present.

So it would be better to describe as something like:

  When interrupt-cells = <3>, the third cell specifies the priority (in
  the range X to Y). When #interrupt-cells = <2> all interrupts are
  assigned the same priority (Z).

Thanks,
Mark.
