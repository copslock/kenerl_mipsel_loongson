But only legacy OSs would need the jumper or the pin. Any modern OS
like Linux should just work in either endianess independent of how
the registers are done.

Well, I guess they failed on the "source-compatible" part ;-)

No, this is just wrong. Don't ever assume that the endianess of the
kernel has anything to do with how the hardware is built. You can
make it a separate Kconfig option, and you can make it default
to CPU_BIG_ENDIAN, but the two things are fundamentally different,
whatever the hardware designers try to tell you.

I didn't mean one kernel image that runs in both BE and LE mode, that
would be crazy. What I mean is one image that can run on the SoC
in either strapping mode but with the CPU endianess set the way that
matches how the kernel is built.

Wow, that seems like a lot of hardware effort to gain basically
nothing. If they managed to get this right, at least it won't
make it harder to support the hardware properly.

So the byte stream data is never swapped, or always swapped an even
number of times, regardless of the strapping pin, right?

This is the part where it gets really crazy and the only sane way to
deal with it is to turn off the entire swizzling in hardware.

That option seems to be incompatible with running one kernel across
multiple SoC families, if each of them does it differently.

The comment in arch/mips/include/asm/mach-generic/mangle-port.h
suggests that it was originally meant only for PIO access, not
for MMIO, but asm/io.h uses it for both.

If all the boards can be configured for LE, then you can just make this
mode required when upstreaming the kernel port, independent of how the
kernel runs.
