 It has been always making me wonder (though not as much to go and dig 
through our code ;) ) why Linux is uncapable of using the value presented 
by the CPU in the CP0 Context register as is, or perhaps after a trivial 
operation such as a left-shift by a constant number of bits (where the 
size of the page entry slot assumed by hardware turned out too small).  
There should be no need to add another constant as in the piece of code 
you have quoted -- this constant should already have been preloaded to 
this register when switching the context the last time.  The design of the 
TLB refill exception in the MIPS Architecture has been such as to allow 
this register to be readily used as an address into the page table.  
Hmm...
