Sure. I would eventually like to explore solutions to efficiently support
the full register range in applications with both 32- and 64-bit kernels.

It's 72308802 as in "mul s1,s1,s0" which I believe is the DSP enhancement
multiplication with register write in the MIPS32 architecture. The R5900
doesn't have those DSP instructions, as far as I can tell.

For this reason the R5900 patch modifies the __{save,restore}_dsp macros,
mips_dsp_state::dspcontrol, DSP_INIT, sigcontext32::sc_dsp, etc. I've seen
the cpu_has_dsp macro too, but haven't looked at the details of this yet.

Considering the lack of DSP instructions, would you know any commonly
compiled mipsel distribution that could be made compatible with the R5900
in a reasonable manner? I suppose Gentoo has an advantage here, given the
ability to supply R5900 compilation flags.

Right. Debian's BusyBox has 857 of those. JÃ¼rgen Urban observed in the
conversation with you in

https://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2013-01/msg00658.html

that RDHWR has the same encoding as "sq v1,-6085(zero)" for the R5900,
which luckily always gives an alignment exception so that the kernel is
able to emulate RDHWR properly. I haven't verified this though.
