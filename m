Nothing in here per se, but a) I don't like this file, it registers
stuff some boards don't need/want,  b) this part is only interesting
for pb1200 board anyway. I moved it to the pb1200 platform.c because
of the function pointers for au1xmmc platdata.

Done.  I originally put it in because of compile errors wrt. BCSR register.

Done and done,

Is this an accepted way of doing things in the kernel?  If not, I'm open to
suggestions! (I prefer this to globally-visible methods called by the
driver.  I like it when related things are neatly grouped together).

I'll add the whole 0x80000 range ;-)

It was a convenient way to pass DDMA IDs without having to use 
a lookup table in the driver ;-)

I like my device setup data in one file (preferably living in the board
subdir), but for mainline inclusion I can move it back to its original
place if you and others prefer so.

Won't this cause problems if e.g. you are using PCMCIA (since SD1 pins are
muxed with pcmcia signals)? 
In any case, I just followed the original code, which also disabled the 2nd
controller for the db1200.

I corrected this (and wrong resource numbering) locally.


Thanks for looking at it!
