Hi,

I could not find the mailing list for decstation Linux.  Perhaps you could
help me...

I have two DecStation 3100s that I must dispose of immediately.  I would
happily provide them to anyone working on the port.

If you know of anyone who could use the machines and is able to pick up the
machines in Berkeley, California they are available for free.

Thank you,

Arthur Britto
