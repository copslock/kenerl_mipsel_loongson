Yes, that is the idea. This was not realistic before, since each one
of the old architectures had its own way of describing the system call
tables, and many needed a different set of quirks.

Since (almost) everything is now converted to the syscall.tbl format,
we have removed all obsolete architectures, and a lot of the quirks
(x32, spu, s390-31) won't matter as much in the future, I think it is
now possible to do it.

We could even extend scripts/checksyscalls.sh to warn if a new
syscall above 423 is not added to all 16 tables at the same time.

We've had a bit of that already, with cacheflush(), which exists on
a couple of architectures, including some that use the first
'arch specific' slot (244) of the asm-generic table. I think this
will be rare enough that we can figure out a solution when we
get there.

I don't mind calling the hole something else if that helps. Out of
principle I would already assume that anything we add for x86
or the generic table should be added everywhere, but we can
make it broader than that.
