I will try to figure out what is happening.  Most of my testing was done 
with an explicit '-c' argument to the perf tool.

Thanks for testing it.

If it is OK with you, and once we have tested it, we could use the last 
patch set you posted to lmo 
(http://patchwork.linux-mips.org/patch/1850/), and add mine on top of it.
