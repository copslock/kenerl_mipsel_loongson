Hi all,

I would like to use hardware watchpoint on one of our mips 5Kc platform.

Before trying to implement it myself from scratch, I would like to know if
there was any open-source attempt from which I can start to work.

I quickly looked at the mailing list archives and it seems that some of you
were trying to do the same thing some week ago.

Thanks all,

Olivier Charra.
