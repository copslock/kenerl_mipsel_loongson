Thanks ;-)

Not sure, but I'll add them too.

Well, that's what my initial submission did, but it required access to the
mmc drivers host structure (moved from au1xmmc.h to au1100_mmc.h) to determine
which controller wants the attention, and you weren't fond of that.

The comment explains what setting to NULL does, so I'd like to
keep it (for people implementing this for other boards and wondering what
to do with thse members...)

Sure, I'll add another patch to the pile.


Thank you!
