Sorry, but this makes no sense. If you run a little-endian kernel
on one of the MIPS systems that you marked as "always BE", or a
big-endian kernel on the systems that are marked "always LE",
then you have to byte swap.

Same for the BCM7xxx MIPS chip if the jumper sets the strapping
pin the opposite way from the running kernel, although I can see
the argument that you would hope nobody does that.
On the other hand, if you give hardware designers two ways to do
something, of course they will do both eventually, so I'm sure
someone has already done it (probably not supported using upstream
Linux)

That is probably the best way forward.

If you want to support "native" you have three endianess settings
to support in your driver, not one, and a run-time selection
that looks at the "big-endian" property in DT as well as the
endianess that the kernel was built for.

The drivers using __raw_ today (exynos, mxs, s3c24xx) are all broken
and should be fixed. This is all old code that was written without
taking endianess into consideration and breaks if you try to run a
big-endian kernel.

That would still break the use of secondary interrupt controllers
using generic irqchip.

This would break the ARM machines, unless you make it depend on
the CPU architecture. You should still check for the "big-endian"
property to see if the strapping pin was actually set the way
you expect it.

In my experience, the opposite is true: hardware designers will put
anything in the SoCs that they happen to need, and disregard the
specifications for endianess if they exist. If you are lucky, each
part gets used in only one form, but some people are crazy enough
to put the byte swaps into hardware and make life miserable for us.

The reconfigurability is definitely the worst part.

Most of these are bugs. About half of them are for Samsung SoCs,
and this is after we've spent a lot of time changing other drivers
for the same chips to use readl() in order to make them work with
big-endian kernels.

Most big-endian drivers come from powerpc, which uses in_be32:

git grep in_be32 | wc -l
    950

These drivers typically work just as well on little-endian kernels.

The FPGA developers are priviledged because they can fix their hardware
when they get it wrong ;-)

This is what I meant with doing extra work in the case where we want to
support both in the same kernel. We would only enable the runtime
logic if both GENERIC_IRQ_CHIP and GENERIC_IRQ_CHIP_BE are set, and
leave it up to the platform to select the right one. For MIPS BCM7xxx,
you could use

config BCM7xxx
	select GENERIC_IRQ_CHIP if CPU_LITTLE_ENDIAN
	select GENERIC_IRQ_CHIP_BE if CPU_BIG_ENDIAN

so you would default to the hardwired big-endian accessor unless
some other drivers selects GENERIC_IRQ_CHIP.
