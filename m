Yes, probably it should be, I will try it.  I was having trouble getting 
the dtc to accept it when I originally came up with the binding.  I will 
try again.

I would prefer not to.  There is already firmware in the field with 
these bindings.  They were discussed here:

http://www.linux-mips.org/archives/linux-mips/2011-06/msg00338.html

Also there is precedence:  Few, if any, of the clock rate and frequency 
properties end in '-hz'
