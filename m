I think it would be good to have detailed information on what exactly
works and does not work in recent versions of the toolchain and
kernel.  While this information is too temporal for the HOWTO, it does
deserve a home.  Perhaps a separate FAQ with this sort of information
is in order.  

The idea is to be able to answer questions like "I'm getting undefined
symbol __foo while building glibc version X.Y.Z on mipsel; what's
wrong?" and "Does linux run on the FOO4161 CPU core?" and of course
the infamous "What toolchain should I use?" with a URL.
