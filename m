Hmm, well, the suggestion was to pass a pointer rather than an offset,
but both you and Wu Zhangjin seem to prefer the offset.  Is there a
reason for that?  I suggested a pointer because

  (a) they're more C-like
  (b) they're just as quick and easy to compute
  (c) MIPS doesn't have indexed addresses (well, except for a few
      special cases) so the callee is going to have to compute the
      pointer at some stage anyway

(It sounds from Wu Zhangjin's reply like he'd alread suggested the
offset thing before I sent my message.  If so, sorry for not using
that earlier message as context.)

We shouldn't need to do the delay slot dance.  With either the pointer
((D)LA) or offset ((D)LI) approach, the macro won't use $at, so we can
insert the new code immediately before the jump, leaving the assembler
to fill the delay slot.  This is simpler and should mean that the delay
slot gets filled more often in the multi-insn-macro cases.

Looks good otherwise, but I'd be interested in other suggestions for
the option name.  I kept misreading "raloc" as a typo for "reloc".
