The list of folks who have committed patches that touch drivers/firmware=20
is large.  I did this as a first-order approximation:

If I were in your shoes, I would suggest either

1. asking Ralf to merge your patches that touch drivers/firmware, since=20
he'll also presumably be merging the parts that touch arch/mips

or=20

2. asking Greg KH to merge those patches

And of course it would not hurt to collect some Reviewed-By:s from other=20
folks.  (See below...)

OK I will take a look at this, and will either send comments, or will=20
send a Reviewed-By:.


Thanks for all of the good discussion on this :-)
