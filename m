Ah, yes.
I was talking to John Carmack about Quake 2, Linux, GL hardware and
such, and while the Indy's not suitable (only gouraud, and Q2 needs
texture mapping), the O2 would be.  If we can get Linux ported to the
O2 as well, we can very likely get a Quake II port.

Should we be controlling access to linus?
