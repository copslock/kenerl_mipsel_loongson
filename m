Please!  Don't think that I am belittling the software engineers!  I
had no intent on doing that.  I *am* one of them.

My point was that SGI is into making hardware.  That's how it started
and that is still its main focus.  Yes, it is true that our software
is very important because it takes advantage of the proprietary stuff
in the hardware, but the main income for SGI is hardware.  Note in any
press releases and stock holder's documents how much is said about the
wonderful software SGI produces (Alias/Wavefront is still a separate
entity).  You won't find much.
