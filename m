This adds device tree support to bcma. In addition it also provides the 
sprom needed by bcma through a device tree driver.
This is needed for the Broadcom BCM47XX/BCM53XX ARM SoCs (NorthStar).

bcma drives the system AIX bus. This bus is scanable, so we 
automatically detect the cores attached to this bus. We only have to 
provide the address of the first core, this can now be done through 
device tree.
It is not possible to find out what IRQ is associated to a specific 
core, we have to provide this through device tree.

Broadcom uses a nvram which is a key value store on the flash chip. 
This nvram contains the mac addresses to be used by the wifi and 
Ethernet devices, the configuration data for the switch, the 
calibration data for the wifi cores and some more stuff. Currently bcma 
assumes to get some sprom when it gets initialized on a SoC. This sprom 
is a structure with all the data which are originally stored in the 
nvram. When bcma is used on a PCIe wifi card this data is fetched from 
some eeporm on the card. The nvram could contains more than one sprom, 
in case there is a main Baordocm SoC and a Broadcom wifi card connected 
via PCIe this PCIe cards mostly use the nvram to store the sprom with 
the calibration data.

This patch series adds two drivers, the nvram driver which reads the 
nvram and provides an interface to fetch values by giving a key and a 
driver which creates a sprom based on a given nvram. These two things 
are no real drivers, they are just converting stuff. I made them 
drivers so they can be replaced with some other drivers which are 
fetching the sprom from other storages. I know that the BCM63XX SoCs 
are also using an sprom, but there it is stored in a file on the file 
system. 

Some code was copied from the mips code at arch/mips/bcm47xx/ in the 
end I want to make this mips code also use these new drivers.

There is no device I know of which uses more than one nvram and I do 
not think there will ever be such a device. With this patch you have to 
provide a reference to the nvram you want to fetch data from which is a 
little bit annoying, should I remove this parameter and assume there is 
just one nvram driver in the system?

I am interested on comments if this architecture is correct or if there 
are some improvements I could do. I haven't fond similar code in the 
kernel.

Through which tree should I merge the final patches?

This is based on linus 3.17-rc1.
