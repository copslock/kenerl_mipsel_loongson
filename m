Eventually the files need to go somewhere other than drivers/staging. 
They are not all Ethernet related, so sorting out exactly where they all 
go is not so simple.  This subject has been a thorn in my side for quite 
some time.

For the sake of getting the Device Tree patching code working and to 
generate Device Tree related feedback, I moved them to be with their kin 
in arch/mips/cavium-octeon/executive.

In the context of this patch set, I consider this to be a somewhat minor 
detail.
