Yes, it happens by default.  But it wasn't magic.  It took careful work 
by the ABI and toolchain designers to make it work.

It is not really a position that I have.  Rather a proposal for one 
possible way to make non-executable stacks work on MIPS.

Any non-executable stack solution for MIPS will require changes to the 
toolchain/libc.  So it is merely a question of what form the change 
should take.

Yes. Similar to how startup code has to do special work to set up the 
TLS areas, and load shared libraries.

No, We don't have to mmap() on each thread creation.  Many threads 
(perhaps 512) could be handled by a single page, so the normal case 
would be a single mmap() for the life of the program.

Have you seen the alternatives?

Have you ever wondered why MIPS doesn't have non-executable stack support?
