That's right.

I don't have a strong preference.  The driver depends on the processor 
support *and* it is only relevant to OCTEON based boards.  If the 
linux-ide maintainers would prefer to merge it via their tree that is 
fine with me.

No, versions 1.0, 1.1, and 2.0 exist, but are living a decadent 
out-of-tree life.

Oh, how would you do something every 16 writes?

> Why not use iowrite16_rep()?

Two reasons.  It is broken, and we need to do something every 16 writes.

We need to be careful not to be anti-social by filling the FIFO.  Once 
the FIFO is filled other cores will be starved of I/O resources.

In 16 bit mode it overlaps the data register, so it must be accessed via 
the 0xc address.

No, It is OCTEON specific.  It fires when a DMA operation is complete. 
As I mentioned earlier, the normal IDE interrupt is not connected to 
anything on most boards.

Which it is not.  So...

The boards that are 'TrueIDE' use two resources, others only one.
