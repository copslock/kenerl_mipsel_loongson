Hello I'm new to this list ...I hope this is the right place to ask for
(if not sorry)...

At the HackLab of firenze we are going to buy an origin 2100, we would
like to install Linux on it (and use it probably as a server)...
I would like to know if it is well supported by Linux-kernel (scsi,
ethernet, pci... ecc ecc)

sorry for bad english !

Cheers !

Michele Carla`
