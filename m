It didn't strike me as that bad, but I also didn't look at any PCI code.

Well, it means at least duplicating most of the chipcommon driver and
the mips core driver. But if you are fine with that, I see no problem
with having a separate driver for the AI bus.

Okay. This is mostly for the embedded case, where it is possible to
create a single kernel that boots on both. The "detection" could also
be done through the cpu type (74k => register AI bus, else SSB bus)
instead of the chipid register of the common core.

Yes, you are right.


So I guess the proposed course of action would be:

1. Make the HND/AI-Bus code from brcm80211 its own independent driver,
2. Re-add the non-wifi related code (chipcommon, mips, etc),
3. Clean up the code until it meets Linux' code style/quality,
4. Move it out of staging,

and finally

5. Add the required arch specific code to bcm47xx for the newer SoCs.

P.S: Any suggestions for the name? Would be "ai" okay? Technically
it's "AMBA Interconnect", but "amba" is already taken.
