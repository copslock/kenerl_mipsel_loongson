:	3. Would it be possible to negotiate with SGI management 
:	   the posibility of shipping the IRIX runtime libraries and
:	   the X server as found on IRIX with a Linux disrtibution?
:

My take on this is that since whoever bought that Indy
already paid for the OS including the X server and other
binaries there should be no reason why not to allow
them to run it on top of linux.

Putting it in a distribution that anyone can download
however is different and would require management approval
could someone on the list ask their directors about this?
