    This certainly may be fixed.

    You may rework driver to always save it on write to 'lcr' field (in case 
of your UART).  I don't think it's going to spoil something there...

    What's *certainly* undesirable is #ifdef mess. :-)

    AFAIR, almost every participant was left with his own opinion. I myself 
changed it twice during the discussion, to finalyl mostly agree with Russell. :-D

> Do you see this as an exception?

    Well, there's already an incident of using this to work around the 
register access errata (that UPIO_TSI I mentioned) -- and I must note that 
this is certainly cleaner than #ifdef's, which should be avoided at all costs. :-)

    Erm... so why is this under #ifdef?

    I must note that "transmitter empty" condition in *not* the cause of the 
THRI interrupt -- it signifies that the TX shift register is empty, not the TX 
holding register.

> In the UART_BUG_DWTHRE case an interrupt IS generated on enabling THRI.

    If there was no prior sent characters, how it's generated?

to the THR and it's sent.

    Again, THRE condition doesn't mean that the charecter is actually sent. I 
only means that it's been stored to the shift register and so, the 
transmission started...

    IIUC, you must *not* send characters to detect it. :-)

    Well, if that errata is indeed not readily detectable at runtime (or even 
effectively the same as already handled),
this seems like the only option indeed...

    May also check for certain UPIO_* once it's introduced...

    I'd consider defining the UART status reg. in serial_reg.h and also doing 
reads via serial_in(),
again under a new UPIO_* case...

> We could add it to one of the data structures like uart_port, but it would need an #ifdef in the header file.

    Add what, register?

    Well, bits 1-2 have no meaning when bit 0 is set. Probably, chip designers 
decided to abuse this. :-)
