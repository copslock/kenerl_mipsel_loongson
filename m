that's trivial to check:
	sed -n '/^struct exception_table_entry/,/};/p'\
		arch/*/include/asm/uaccess* include/asm-generic/uaccess.h=20

and indeed, the only arches that don't follow this model are the ones that=
=20
define ARCH_HAS_SORT_EXTABLE.

a trivial sed/grep gets you the answer: they're all the same

this is what linux-next is for :)
