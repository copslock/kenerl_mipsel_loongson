    I wasn't criticizing anything or anyone.  Just trying to get more
information.  Considering I had questions our SGI Tech/Salesmen combo
could not answer.

    No need to take anything personal.  I'm just asking for information
and you guys get jumpy.  I have nothing bad to say about the O2k hardware,
I'm just curious about it's architecture and how exactly "bandwidth" is
measured, since it's not as straightforward as in an SMP system.
