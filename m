That is also what I am wondering about. Considering that previous BCM47xx 
platforms use a MIPS4k core and newer one use MIPS74k or later, you would not 
be able to build a single kernel for both which takes advantages of compile-
time optimizations targetting MIPS74k. If this ist not a big concern, then 
let's target a single kernel.
