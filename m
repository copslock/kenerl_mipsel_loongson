Will the owner of the hinv work-alike for Linux please stand up? I
posted info about this script in a local group which (unknown to me)
was gatewayed to one of the c.o.l groups, and now am snowed under with 
requests for the script.

I got the script from the erstwhile linux.engr.sgi.com box.

Request the owner to (a) identify him/herself and (b) indicate if it's 
OK to post the script on one of the Linux groups. Please also indicate 
copyright terms if you're inclined that way.

Thanks,
