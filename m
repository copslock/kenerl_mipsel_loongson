That was never the case.

And these days, additions to procfs are insta-deprecated.  New code 
should start out with sysfs.

An alias for a non-zero PHY ID.

Did you read my example code?  It clearly scans PHY ID 0.  What would break?

We are not inclined to merge Yet Another Duplicate of mii.c, which means 
twice the maintenance headache over the lifetime of the Linux kernel.

Are writes delayed or posted in any way?

If yes, then the timing of mdelay() is not guaranteed.  Normally you 
must issue a read, following a write, before your delay.  That 
guarantees the full delay occurs after the write reaches the MAC.

See the "if only silly wrappers" comment.  You should create a 
DMA-mapping API, even if it intentionally degenerates inside the 
compiler's optimizer to a direct memory access and/or no-ops.  The gives 
the driver well-defined access points for accessing memory with unusual 
attributes such as uncached memory segments.

This again revisits the issue of /not/ duplicating code that exists 
elsewhere.  The CONFIG_MSPETH_NAPI choice is essentially between "NAPI" 
and "NAPI implemented solely within our driver".  Drivers that permit a 
NAPI compilation choice allow the user to choose between no software 
mitigation (no-NAPI) or software mitigation.  That is a reasonable choice.

But including your own software mitigation scheme is wasteful, and 
different from the NAPI/no-NAPI configurations that normally get accepted.
