Without further explanation this one just sounds bizarre for now.

There always have been differences between the code generated by binutils
in the various versions; the resulting changes may result in different
behaviour of a broken programs.  These are fun to debug to say the least.
The other possibility would be binutils bugs but I'm not aware of one
with the effect you described.
