Hello !

There are several changes to the code that has been checked in. However, these changes have not been put into linux-mips as yet. I have updated copies of the source code with me. I intend to do that sometime soon. If you wish I can send you my copies. Linux is completely working on Yosemite and we have customers using them.

Thanks
Manish

Hi Manish,

I am having mail problems and I am afraid my previous mail to you got lost. If 
it did not, please do not feel offended, I am not writing a second mail to 
press you to answer.

I just started to play with my brand new yosemite and half dome boards. The 
first thing I did was downloading the latest kernel sources from 
linux-mips.org CVS and found that support for the yosemite board is all 
broken. The files contain syntactic errors and do not even compile. The same 
is true for the titan ethernet driver.

Would you mind commenting on the state of the port? I'd be happy to help 
completing it if any help is required.

greetings,
tk
