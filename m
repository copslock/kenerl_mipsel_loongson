Hello,

I added news about 2.4.16 and 2.5.0 being in CVS on:
http://www.linuxmips.net/news.php4


Please, if anyone else has any news, drop me a line at
ian@ichilton.co.uk so we can add it and keep the news updated!!

Stuff like "I ported this to mips", "New kernel in cvs", "x kernel
boots", "xx distro available here:..." etc is always welcome!

In 2 weeks time when I have time off for Christmas, I hope to update the
whole site too - for starters it's not linux-mips.org anymore but
linuxmips.net


Thanks

Ian
