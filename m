I don't know, but I doubt it exists. Main problem would be developing
an appropriate chipset (different processor bus, maybe big endian,
maybe 64bit).

Nearly every CPU other than x86 would be cheaper in mass production.
Unfortunately, mass production seems not to happen.

You might ask e.g. Sibyte about it. :-)
