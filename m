As someone mentioned earlier (and what I am lead to understand) the R12K
is in pre-production now, which is much more than a concept on paper.  Is
this correct? 

As far as Intel being able to leap-frog ahead in the long-run, I wouldn't
count on it.  I've always believed that money can't buy everything,
especially in engineering.  

Or maybe I like to root for the underdog :-)
