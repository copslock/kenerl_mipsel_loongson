What is a "BE system" then? Is the CPU core not capable of running
code either way?

Most of those are handled by the compiler. Bitfields are of course
a problem when they are accessed through DMA, but I would assume
that this is still a problem with the hardware byteswap hack that
the Broadcom SoCs have.

Of course, anything that uses __raw_readl on an MMIO register is
broken if you try to do this, which was my point the whole time.

Yes, it should work on any architecture that supports both modes. It
definitely works on all ARM cores I know, and on most PowerPC cores.
I always assumed that MIPS was bi-endian as well, but according to
what you say I guess it is not.

ARM and PowerPC can actually switch endianess in the kernel, and this
is what they do in the first instruction when you run a different
endianess from what the boot loader runs as it calls into the kernel.
The ARM boot protocol requires entering the kernel in little-endian
mode, while I think on PowerPC the boot loader is supposed to detect
the format of the kernel binary and pick the right mode before calling
it.

I don't know. Thomas' reply suggests that it isn't. Doing byteswap
in software at a register access is usually free in terms of CPU
cycles, but an indirect function call can be noticeable if we do
that a lot.

If we can prove at compile-time that all users of irq_reg_{readl,writel}
are the same, then I think it's ok to hardcode it, but of course if
any driver we build needs the opposite of the others, or needs CPU-endian
access, then it definitely can't work.
