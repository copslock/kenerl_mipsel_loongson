This is obvioulsy very good news; would it be possible for SGI to comment
on exactly how they can support us further?

SGI's done a great deal to help us this far, I'm really looking forward t
odoing more SGI/Linux stuff.  I see the biggest area where we need help in
getting more hardware supported.  That requires getting documentation.  I
think it would be great if SGI could allocate someone's time to find said
documentation.
