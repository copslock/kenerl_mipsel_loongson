libc and glibc binary RPMs would be appreciated. How about gcc and
binutils for big endian as well?

Okay.  I'm getting somewhere now.  I know I'm behind most people, but my
system now boots with a local root.

Does anyone have an editor?  It's a bit of a pain to have to FTP things
over to my i386 box, change, and re-FTP.

I'm attempting to build some more RPMs, but I'm hitting some snags with my
setup. Details as they become available...
