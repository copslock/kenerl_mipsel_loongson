Most.

Yes, currently some archs store MEM and IO resource in pci sysdata, and others not, move the MEM and IO
resource to pci_host_bride could make code become simple, we can clean up the resource list argument in
pci scan functions.

Now, I got it, thanks!

This is a good idea, what I'm worried is this series is already large, so I think we need to post
another series to do it.

Currently, a property "msi-parent" was introduced in arm, and all msi chip integrated in irq chip controller will
be added to of_pci_msi_chip_list. PCI host driver find the match msi chip by its of_node.
