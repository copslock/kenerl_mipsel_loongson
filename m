Wouldn't it be a good idea to change the information for the Linux/MIPS
project on http://www.linux.org/projects/ports.html to
the new web sites and the mailing list on oss?

I think especially people looking for a Linux on MIPS project for the
first time come across that information and subscribe to the fnet list
first, so changing that data would be a first step for a possible shutdown
of the fnet list at some time in the future.

I ask the linux.org site maintainers if they could change the information,
if desired. But I am not sure which web site to use as the primary site
of the Linux/MIPS project. 
Comments?
