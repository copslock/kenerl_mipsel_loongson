Yeah, and probably not as important in the mips world, as it is used
more with embedded devices than desktops. We must always take the
"paranoid" approach for tracing. At least in PPC and x86, we assume
everything is broken ;-)  And we want to be as robust as possible. If
something goes wrong, we want to detect it ASAP and report it. And keep
the system from crashing.

At least with MIPS we don't need to worry about crashing Linus's
desktop. With is the #1 priority we have on x86 ... "Don't crash Linus's
desktop!".

If Linus sees a warning, he'll bitch at us. If we crash his box, and he
was to lose any information, he'll strip out our code!

Yes with -mlong-calls you must jump pass the setting up of the jalr.

Note, you are commenting different than your code. Your code matches
more what I want than your comments ;-)  You keep saying "if the
instruction just after the jump to mcount (and preparation for) is not a
store than it is a leaf", where I'm saying (and the code matches),
search above the jump to mcount and if we don't find the store of ra,
then it is a leaf.

I would be even more paranoid, and make sure each of those stores, store
into sp.

The ftrace_push_return_trace does not test if the trace stopped, that is
expected to be done by the caller. If you mess with the stack set up,
you will crash the box. Remember, before the failure, you could have
already replaced return jumps. Those will still be falling back to the
return_to_handler. If you mess with the stack, but don't update the
return, the other returns will be out of sync and call the wrong return
address.
