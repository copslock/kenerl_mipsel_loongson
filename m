Thanks.  Will update.

Understood.  Will update to use clk_hw_onecell_data and change the 
registration accordingly.

Some peripheral drivers want to use same code cross platforms.

But not all platforms provide HW gate clock.  So in this case, clock 
driver creates

a virtual gate clock to make it work if no HW gate clock in the SoC.

Yes, CPU clock is providing CPU frequency in the early boot stage.

Will put the non-critical clocks in the platform driver.
