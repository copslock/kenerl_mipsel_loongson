Strictly speaking we cannot sell to USA yet, because we did not get some 
required certifications for USA and Europe market(e.g. FCC, RoHS).
But we can provide a sample if the customer can understand the status.

Lemote has sold out around 1000 sets of Fulong, most users are in China. 
We don't have a distributor ourside of China yet, due to the lack of 
certifications and experience of oversea business. I think we will 
probably get some such distributors within this year, along with the 
upgraded versions of Fulong.
