Jurij,

to raise your optimism - a Polish developper recently managed to get the
the similar but more complex graphics of the Octane to work.  Another
core problem, the lack of freely available documentation for the R8000's
processor was also solved now that finally after solving the underlying
legal problem MIPS was able to give me permission to distribute
documentation for the system.  In short I believe now we have all the
necessary bits and pieces in order to support your Indigo 2 and need to
enter the "just do it" phase ...

  Ralf
