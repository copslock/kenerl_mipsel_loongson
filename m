I can imagine all sorts of 'uses' for something like this (linux on the
N64) - but one thing crops
up, I thought there WAS an N64 port.

I seem to remember something, may have been an article on IX magazine...

The word "spine" is, of course, an anagram of "penis".  This is true in
almost fifty percent of the languages of the Galaxy, and many people
have attempted to explain why.  Usually these explanations get bogged
down in silly puns about "standing erect".
