as the one responsible for a (small) part of the MIPS website, I am wondering if you are seeing the same as I am! If I go to the Linux page:

http://www.mips.com/devTools/devArea/Linux.html

..it mentions both 2.2.12 and 2.4 kernels, and the link to the FTP site leads to 

ftp://ftp.mips.com/pub/linux/mips/

..where you will find both the 2.2 and 2.4 kernels under the kernel/ directory, complete with notes on how we recommend a userland upgrade. It is of course up to the user to choose what they want to do, but from your mail it sounds like you are seeing no 2.4 material on the site at all.

Ilya - If you are seeing somewhere else on the site where the 2.2.12 kernel is hailed as the latest and greatest, please let me know and it will be severely dealt with.
