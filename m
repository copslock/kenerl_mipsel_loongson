If by "boot locally" you mean booting the Linux kernel directly from
local hard disk, then yes, it is true (at least for Indys.)  There are
several installation howtos out there, two of them are
http://www.stafwag.f2s.com/indy/?lang=eng and
http://www.ping.uio.no/~toffer/indy-sid.txt .  They both contain URLs
to kernels you can use.
