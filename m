I agree, it sounds like the problem is the switch from small windows
to big ones.  In order for the PCI core to work correctly, the host
bridge window ("1f200000-1f9fffff : Bridge MEM") must enclose the BARs
of the devices below the bridge.

If you use the big windows for the device BARs, you should use big
windows for the host bridge windows.  I think we're talking about
widget 0xf here, so the 0xf big window would be 0xf0_0000_0000 -
0xff_ffff_ffff.  This should all be set up *before* calling
pci_scan_root_bus() instead of after, as it seems to be today.

The scan would look like this:

  pci_bus 0000:00: root bus resource [mem 0xf000000000-0xffffffffff] (bus addresses [0x00000000-0xfffffffff])
  pci 0000:00:00.0: reg 0x14: [mem 0xf000200000-0xf000200fff]
  pci 0000:00:00.0: reg 0x30: [mem 0xf000210000-0xf00021ffff pref]
  pci 0000:00:01.0: reg 0x14: [mem 0xf000400000-0xf000400fff]
  pci 0000:00:01.0: reg 0x30: [mem 0xf000410000-0xf00041ffff pref]
  pci 0000:00:02.0: reg 0x10: [mem 0xf000500000-0xf0005fffff]
  pci 0000:00:03.0: reg 0x10: [mem 0xf000600000-0xf000601fff]

This would make /proc/iomem look like this:

  f000000000-ffffffffff : Bridge MEM
    f000500000-f0005fffff : 0000:00:02.0
    f000210000-f00021ffff : 0000:00:00.0
    f000410000-f00041ffff : 0000:00:01.0
    f000200000-f000200fff : 0000:00:00.0
    f000400000-f000400fff : 0000:00:01.0

This doesn't match the device BARs in your /proc/iomem, so there must
be some other transformation going on as well.

As long as you tell the PCI core about the host bridge windows you're
going to use, along with offsets that include *all* these
transformations, the core should just work, and /proc/iomem should
also make sense.  The details of small/medium/big windows, widgets,
etc., are immaterial to the core.
