I would think that the reason they might want to have Linux running on
some embedded system is the same as the reason Microsoft wants to run
Windows on your microwave oven/television/VCR/etc...

I'm sure it isn't "Windows", it's just the core drivers and stuff.  I
think the ultimate goal of Microsoft is to allow people to have
everything electrical in their house networked together.  Then they
could turn on the microwave by logging into their home computer and
telling it to turn on the microwave (of course that's just a
pedagogical example).

FYI, according to an article I read in New Yorker, Microsoft's goal is
to get money every time one of their products is used.  Thus, with the
above scenerio, they could get a penny because you logged into your
home computer and another penny because you enabled your microwave.

I'd prefer to have Linux as the embedded system.  Then my microwave
can run some program using X windows and display it on my home
computer's X server and Microsoft doesn't get anything!  :-)
