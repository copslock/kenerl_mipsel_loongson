Dear Sir/Madam,

Do you feel lost?  Lonely in the modern world?
Or perhaps you're just figuring out your role in life.

If this sounds like you, then Clausen Profit Systems can help!

Follow these 4 easy steps:

(1) download GNU Parted 1.5.5-pre5:

	ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/parted/devel/parted-1.5.5-pre5.tar.gz

(you might want to check for a newer version, in case I find some
obvious bugs)

(2) compile, and test it - preferrably on a spare disk! ;)  Note: Parted
can run even if it has read-only permission

(3) send bug reports to bug-parted@gnu.org

(4) rm /sbin/fdisk
