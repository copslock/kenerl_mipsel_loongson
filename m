Hello,

Is progress being made on this port on a weekly basis?

If so can we start having whoever codes whatever start posting the progress
on a weekly/monthly basis?

I know lots of this information gets distributed via IRC but someone should
let everyone, who's not on IRC all the time, know what's going on and what
progress is being made.

I mean are we close to having a working port or really far off?

Thoughts?
