I see. Makes sense.

Ok. One more thought: With the powerpc-approach of having platform
specific boot wrappers (with or without uncompress code), the boot
protocol would no longer matter to the common multiplatform
implementation, and the specific BMIPS interface would become
part of arch/mips/boot/bmips.c or something like that. Looking at
the Makefile in there, MIPS already supports six different binary
formats that can all be generated from the same vmlinux, so at the
point when someone implements a full multiplatform implementation,
the bmips specifics can become another binary format that encapsulates
the vmlinux file and an optional dtb file and passes the dtb
into the common kernel entry point when calling the actual vmlinux
head.S.

Yes, the cacheflush again would have to be abstracted. This is normally
done using either a platform-specific dma_map_ops struct, or using
a further abstraction with another function pointer.

I'm surprised that you need the special flush operation only
for 'unmap' and not for 'dma_sync_*_for_cpu'. Can you check that
you are actually doing the right thing for drivers that reuse
a DMA buffer with the streaming API?

I guess a platform that doesn't fit the simple model could always
have its own dma_map_ops and not use the the dma-coherence.h interfaces.
