I don't know much about the N64, but it should have at least two game
controller ports for a keyboard and a mouse, and I think I heard that
there were storage devices available for it.  With an upgrade to 8 MB, it
sounds like it could possibly be made into a cheap NC or WebTV type of
product.  Of course, as others have mentioned, any kernel port is valuable
at least in the sense that we might learn something new which could aid in
the design of kernels for other architectures.
