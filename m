Hi all

I managed to get the first install screen un my Indy R4600.
(hardhat 5.1).
When it asks me which disk is going to be used (i have two disks, the second 
one empty and partitioned as described in the README file) and I answer 
/dev/sdc it crashes (also if i select /dev/sda !).

Whi???????

Thanks Enrico
