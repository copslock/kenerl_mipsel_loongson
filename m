Now that I can get to www.linux.sgi.com (Thanks Ariel) I have noticed
that the last modified dates on the web page are in Spanish (I think). 
I realise that Spanish is spoken by a substantial portion of the world
population, but I think it's probably not good practise to have mixed
language on the one web page, especially when it is three letter
abbreviations....sort of looks like a typo to many people!

If no one has any violent objections I will change the enumerated list
in /src/web/status-update to English abbreviations.

Cheers, Alistair
