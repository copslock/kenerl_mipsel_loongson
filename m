We can probably kill set_swbp()/set_orig_insn() but with container_of()
tweak, we don't need to.

Yes I tried to implement it. Seems it's not safe to use MSB. Let me explain
this at the end.

Sure, thanks for giving your opinion.

Yes, it's quite possible. So the design will remain same as current set of
patches(v5). v5 basically forces to use only one reference counter for one
uprobe, the new design will allow 0 as a special value for reference counter
_offset_. But still two non-zero reference counter offset for same uprobe
won't be allowed. So there won't be any major changes in the code. Only few
tweaks are needed. I've initial draft ready and it seems working. I'll test
it properly and send it as v6.

Ok. With first approach, we wants to allow multiple reference counter by
making ref_ctr_offset a consumer property. Now let's say one application
rely on kernel to maintain reference counter and other wants to maintain
on his own, and if we use MSB, reference counter value can not be
consistent. For ex,

  step1.
   app1 calls uprobe_register(inode1, off1, consumer{ref_ctr_offset = 0x123});
   kernel will use MSB and thus reference counter is 0x8000

  step2.
   app2 calls uprobe_register(inode1, off1, consumer{ref_ctr_offset = 0x0});
   and modifies reference counter by changing MSB. So reference
   counter is still 0x8000

  step3.
   app2 calls uprobe_unregister();
   and modifies reference counter by resetting MSB. So reference
   counter becomes 0x0000

  ... which is wrong.

Now, with second approach, we are making uprobe_register_refctr()
and uprobe_register() mutually exclusive. So, step2 in above example
is not possible. i.e. Either kernel can use MSB or user can use
MSB, but both can't at the same time. So it's quite safe to use MSB
with this approach. BUT, as this is all userspace, we can't assume
anything. If user has totally different mechanism for tracing SDT
event, he can still use uprobe infrastructure(which will use MSB)
and his own mechanism which will use MSB as well and again we are
screwed! So, IMO, it's not safe to use MSB. Better to stick with
increment/decrement ABI. Please let me know if you disagree. Anyway,
if we go by second approach, increment/decrement are always balanced.
So no need to use MSB with second approach.

Hmm, but for third approach, we have same issue as first approach so
it's not safe to use MSB with third approach as well.

Thanks,
Ravi
