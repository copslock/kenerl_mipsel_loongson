I had said that I would write this, and I will. It will be written from
the stance of a relative newbie.

As it stands, I have some ideas on how to do this.  What I'm missing is
the actual hardware to do it on.  As I get my system booting, I will
document every step.

The *REAL* fun for me starts when my Indy arrives, hopefully next week.
Thanks, Ariel!

Yes, it will help.

How are things on the native booting front?

I had mailed Erik Troan a couple of days ago w.r.t. getting the RH install
code for Alan and myself, but I haven't heard anything yet.
