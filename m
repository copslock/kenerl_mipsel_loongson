What's the difference anyway.  Origin 2000 with graphics option was sold
as Onyx 2; the basic architecture of both is identical.  SGI just never
built the planned graphics option for the Origin 200 which is why the
machine still comes with the keyboard and mouse connectors on the
backside which I'm not even sure of if any software is supportign them
at all.
