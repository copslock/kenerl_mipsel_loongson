Hello everybody,

can anybody tell from where to get a Big Endian cross tool chain 
for compiling a ramdisk source for mips(idt)..
on linux/intel host environment.

i have downloaded one from net but that is not working and 
saying

mips-linux-gcc: installaton problem cannot exec cc1..

alternatively if i can get a precompiled big endian elf format 
ramdisk...?

any pointer would be much helpful..

Best Regards,
