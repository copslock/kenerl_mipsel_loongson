I believe the _for_device function needs to be used to transfer ownership of the buffer back to the device, before calling _for_cpu again later for another read.

What I meant was that the DMA sync calls reflect the ownership transfer of the memory regions. In this case ownership is transferred between device and CPU multiple times and the code reflects that.

At least in MIPS I'm sure it isn't. If I remember correctly, it also isn't on ARM, so I'm pretty sure that either your understanding of the API is incorrect, or arch code does not implement it properly. In either case, this change (and probably also the p54 one) should not be merged.
