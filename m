Thanks.  I see a NIEN quirk in ide-iops.c that's enabled for the hard
drive model I've got on my yeeloong, but that's not even compiled in my
freeloong builds.  I don't see any changes in libata between 4.19 and
4.20 that could explain the regression either.

I'm afraid there's no observable change in behavior after installing the
proposed patch at
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-mips/20190106124607.GK27785@darkstar.musicnaut.iki.fi/

The kernel still disables irq14 early on, and then runs slow.


Tom, why do you say bisecting this is impossible?  I realize you wrote
you did so for 24 hours non-stop, but...  I'm curious as to what
obstacles you ran into.  It's such a reproducible problem for me that I
can't see how bisecting it might be difficult.

Or were by any chance you talking about the reboot/shutdown problem
then?
