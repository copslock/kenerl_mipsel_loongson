Hi.

As I understand the current stable release of binutils and gcc is not able
to compile functional modules. 
Sadly I am not able to use the CVS (Thanks to our super-secure admins, who
lock every port possible).

So here is my question: Does anybody provide snapshots of the CVS (or maybe
binaries for x86 that support modules) for download?

Thanks.

Best regards
