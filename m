You sound a bit disappointed. Well, I can imagine, but you should
give people more time. I had planned to look into your bug tracker,
but didn't found the time yet (Your mail was still in my inbox).

Concerning the boot output parser:

I think it is really useful to know what configurations / kernel versions
and hardware other people have. I have published the bootlogs of
my DECStations on my website. 

By the way, you could update your mips-linux webpages in respect to
DECStations from my info: http://www.xs4all.nl/~vhouten/mipsel

I'm currently running kernel 2.4.0-test9, and I'm in the process
of rebuilding RedHat 6.1 packages to get a minimal distribution ready.
