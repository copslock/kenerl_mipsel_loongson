I know, right? :-/

Yes, we're trying to maintain compatibility, but should be able to 
accept either form, with the "-ps" version being the binding documented.

The OCTEON MMC controller supports up to 4 slots of MMC, eMMC or SD 
types. The board I have (a Rhino Labs UTM8) has both a uSD card slot and 
eMMC device connected to the controller - the best way to describe this 
is via multiple slot nodes as children of the controller.
