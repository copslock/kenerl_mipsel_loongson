Heh, not only software engineers are so crazy ;)

Yes, that's the very purpose of my patchset.

Well, we haven't reached the consensus.  The discussion faded away
somehow mainly because I had too little time to update and ping people
again.

In Tokyo, I talked with some guys regarding this.  Ben agreed to take
this approach for ppc, and David said that he doesn't mind for sparc
part.   Fujita-san mentioned it's no big problem to add one op from
the generic dma_ops.

So, maybe somehow need to convince James in the end (and ask Paul to
check SH part, too), then it'll be all up... theoretically :)

Anyway, I'm going to raise the discussion again on linux-arch.
I'm afraid it's a bit too late game for 2.6.33, but starting now is
better than too late again.


thanks,

Takashi
