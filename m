Look for "The mips programmers refenence manual".  (Faquar and Bunce ?) (   
R2000 / R3000 )
"The MIPS RISC architecture". (Kane ?) ( mentions R4000 but contrates on   
the R2000 / R3000 )
Both books were availible recently.
I have both books at home, (I do complete crap in windoze for a living),   
also look at xspim and spim the
simulator for the R2000, R3000. Think it was on sunsite...

Hope this helps..

PS. Anyone got a spare motherboard for a DS3100 ?

I assume you only refer to the system documentation.  The CPU   
documentation
is available for free from {sgigate,www}.sgi.com and a couple of
Mips silicon manufacturers like {ftp,www}.idt.com and others more.

I asked some people at SGI and they'll try to dig out what still
exists.  Somebody came up with a quite nice link for owners of
historic SGI machines.  Check out the site, there is a link to it
on www.linux.sgi.com.
