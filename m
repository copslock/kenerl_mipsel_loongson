Exactly.

Sorry, but no. The camera has been designed to be used in industrial
control applications, such as quality assurance. Think of an automated
inspection of a certain product, where the inspection is integrated
into the production process. Faulty products are sorted out. For this to
work it is absolutely necessary to get the maximum speed (image frames
per second) out of the hardware, so image acquisition and processing
must be carried out in parallel. The way to achieve this is have the
driver manage a queue of image buffers to fill, so it will continue
grabbing images even if no read operation is currently pending. Also,
the ability to attach user-specific context information to every buffer
is essential.

Another reason to choose this API was to ease customer migration from
PC-based solutions involving IEEE-1394 and Gigabit Ethernet cameras
(of which my employer is a major manufacturer) to the eXcite platform.
These devices ship with driver software that implements a very similar
API, and we provide user-space libraries that allow for writing generic
software that will run on the eXcite platform as well as on a PC with
a dumb camera attached via FireWire or GigE. There is an entire
software framework, of which this driver is just a small component.

Finally, the camera already ships with the software as is, so changing
the API is out of the question, as it would break customer applications.

Thanks for taking the time to look at the code!
