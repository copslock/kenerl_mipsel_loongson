Hi Alexandre,

 I'm away on holiday and also connectivity is so-so here, so just a quick 
reply.

 Thanks for looking into it.

 So this seems backwards to me, port I/O is supposed to be strongly 
ordered, so if removing the ordering guarantee "fixes" your problem, then 
there must be a second bottom here.  Offhand either there is a race 
condition somewhere which the lack of ordering here covers somehow, or 
there is a silicon erratum of some sort somewhere that the SYNC 
instruction triggers.

 A further investigation is required I'm afraid.  Does your platform use 
`war_io_reorder_wmb'?
