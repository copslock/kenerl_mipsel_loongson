    I should also apologize for my discussion style back then -- I just was 
short of time (and now I am as well), and might have gotten too nervous for 
that reason...

    It was good in theory but the practice has shown that this approach had a 
breache.

    Of course.

    As they say, "patches welcome". :-)

    Good question...
    It was probably easier to get all info from one place than to parse the 
resources. :-)

    More like necessary evil since Pantelis decided to merge support for the 
Alchemy UARTs... :-)

    Could you remind regarding which exactly code Russell has said this,
the one in autoconfig_read_divisor_id()?  Are you sure this code gets actually 
called for your UART or Alchemy one?  From looking at the code, I could 
conclude that it shouldn't be -- IIR (sharing address with EFR) shouldn't be 
reading as zero unless the modem status interrupt is pending -- that's what 
the EFR detection code counts on...
     But anyway, I don't see why this code is unsafe to convert to using the 
dl_serail_read/write accessors...

    Why would it be unacceptable, if the like code is already there, in the 
driver?

    I'm afraid you're on your own with resolving the issues now, as the serial 
drivers are no longer maintaned by anybody (so, you probably will have to work 
with Andrew Morton)...
