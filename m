Looks like I may be getting a machine here to see if we can migrate
some of our non-Oracle machines to Linux/SPARC.

Anyone know if the emulation is up to hosting the Linux/Indy
cross-compiler?

In related news, we'll then have Linux running on 5 architectures in
the same room (Intel, Alpha, SPARC, ELKS, Indy).  Maybe I'll steal the
PowerMac too... =)
