I have been given an SGI Onyx2 rackmount system with 16 MIPS RS10000 
processors. I want to put linux on it and I was wondering if anyone had 
experience of linux on this system or would recommend a flavour of linux 
  for it.

I have a collection of RedHat servers at the moment so something that 
would allow me to integrate them would be good.

Please forgive me and point me in the right direction if this is not the 
correct list to be sending this message to.
