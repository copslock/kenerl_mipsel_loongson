Ah, I think I understand what you mean now. So this strapping is done
for legacy operating systems that are not endian-aware and hardwired
to one or the other.

In Linux, we don't care about that, we have the source and we can
just make it run on any hardware we care about. If you port a kernel
to such a platform, the best strategy is to ignore what the SoC
vendor tried to do for the other OSs and set the chip into "never
translate" in hardware so you can handle it correctly in the kernel.

Presumably you want to keep the boot loader, so unfortunately
that can mean having to override the setting in early kernel code
before you touch any hardware. The nasty part is when the hardware
designers put a byteswap logic in front of the flash, because then
you have to create an image that stores the bootloader in opposite
endianess from the kernel, but I'd assume that's still better than
the hacks from the vendor BSP.

You have multiple problems if you rely on the byteswaps being
done in hardware:

- You can't build a kernel that runs on all SoCs, not even all
  systems using the same SoC when that strapping pin gives you
  two incompatible versions

- Any MMIO access to device memory storing byte streams (network
  packets, audio, block, ...) will be swapped the same way that
  the registers do, which means you now have to do the expensive
  byte swaps (memcpy_fromio) in software instead of the cheap ones
  (writel)

- If the hardware swap was implemented wrong, all the addresses
  for 8 or 16 bit MMIO registers are wrong too and you have to
  fix them up in software, which is much worse than swapping the
  contents.

- It's impossible to share device drivers with saner hardware
  platforms that let the CPU access MMIO registers in whichever
  way the device expects it.

Any sane SoC will come without byteswapping on the buses, so that's
trivial to handle. You just have to build kernel and userspace in the
same endianess and have to ensure that all drivers use the correct
accessors that match what the hardware does.

The Samsung platforms get it wrong because they tried to optimize
out the barriers implied by writel, before we had writel_relaxed.
When nobody made a mistake like that, you can run a kernel of either
endianess on any hardware.

Good point. It seems that there is currently no support for BCM7xxx
in upstream Linux, and that is the only one that has the crazy
strapping pin, so I guess you could avoid a lot of the problems by
changing the MIPS code to assume BE registers, and if anybody wants
to submit BCM7xxx MIPS support to mainline, they have to make sure
it's in the right mode.
