A few things could fill that gap (with which I'm experimenting a lot
right now). An upcoming promise is gIDE, which could well fill the role
of a project manager. Interface Design a-la VB can be very well done
with the FLTK toolkit (http://fltk.easysw.com/) which, in my humble
opinion of an application programmer, is the best thing to hit the world
since the invention of the bread-slicing knife.

There's also the JX/JCC (Code Crusader) combination, which unfortunately
is such a pita to compile that I refuse to take it seriously :-)
