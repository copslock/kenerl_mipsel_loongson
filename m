I think the patch (http://patchwork.linux-mips.org/patch/6419/) should be
applied.  The argumentation for reserving ports in the platform code are
the same as on x86 - touch the registers and bad things may happen.  This
is because a fair number of older MIPS platforms were based on x86 chipsets
or at least are using very similar designs.

The fact that on certain platforms such as Loongson, some Octeon systems
and others the request_region() call to reserve the keyboard call succeeds
is by accident not design.

I wish i8042.c was a real platform driver, not using platform_create_bundle.
That would leave a natural place in the arch/platform code to deal with
I/O port allocation and platform_device creation, as necessary for a
platform.
