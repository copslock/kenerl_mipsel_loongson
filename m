Big Sur has been rather popular name for things:

 o an early dual-processor Itanium system from Intel
 o a PMC-Sierra FPGA-based platform.  It was deleted a while ago except the
   network driver for it.  This is what my question was about.
 o Broadcom's BCM1480-based Big Sur 
 o A wireless chipset

I blame so much of the industry being located in California for it :)
