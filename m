Has anyone managed to get the ATI Victoria graphics card working on the MIPS
Malta development board with Linux? This is the card that MIPS specify for
use with the Malta board with another OS (which I shall refrain from
naming).

There does seem to be some code for the ATI Rage XL hardware (as used on the
card) in v2.4.6 of the kernel.
