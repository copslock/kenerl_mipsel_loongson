Fair enough.  Perhaps a comment for the patch rather than in Kconfig
as it currently is.  People will enable it then go 'Why can't I now
enable the touchscreen driver?'

I can't recall off the top of my head if sysfs attributes can having multiple
simultaneous readers. If they can then thread two is just past the next line.
Whilst the earlier thread has passed the t = wait.... line as the interrupt has
fired.  The irq is then disabled by thread 1 whilst thread 2 enables the adc.
Clearly the timeout will prevent any serious issues but the 2nd thread is going
to falsely wait a second I think... ?

You are welcome.
