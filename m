All,

Howdy, I have an SGI Indy currently running Irix 6.5.?, with an IndyCam. There 
is currently some corrupt software, which is causing the camera not to work. 

I have been hunting for a copy of Irix, but was unable to find one as of yet. I 
have been suggested NetBSD, but did not know what IndyCam support was like and 
decided to stick with Irix for now. 

Now that I hear that SGI is supporting a port of Linux to the mips, is there 
any chance that there is support for the IndyCam, or software to view the video 
input?

I am interested in dual booting with Irix also, but first would like to 
establish if there is any preliminary support for the IndyCam before installing 
linux-mips.

TIA.

Regards,

James Mclean
