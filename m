Paul's patch :-)

As for the reason why the definition is as it is - 32-bit MIPS was
born using long, then in 2000 64-bit MIPS started off as arch/mips64
using int.  Eventually the two ports were combined using:

ypedef struct {
#if (_MIPS_SZLONG == 32)
        long    val[2];
#endif
#if (_MIPS_SZLONG == 64)
        int     val[2];
#endif
} __kernel_fsid_t;

A desparate attempt to use asm-generic where ever possible then resulted
in the confusing definition we'e having today.

Normally APIs are cast into stone not to be changed.  But fsid is used in
struct statfs and the man page states "Nobody knows what f_fsid is supposed
to contain (but see below)." and f_fsid is supposed to be opaque anyway so
I'm wondering if something could break at all.  Researching that.
