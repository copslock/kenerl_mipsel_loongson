Ugh ... not exactly, re-watch my talk on the matter :-) While there is
a specific lane wiring to preserve byte addresss, in the end it's the
end device itself that is either BE or LE. Regardless of any "bus
endianness".

Even then, you can have on-SoC (non-PCI) devices that also have a
different endianness from the main CPU. How does it work on ARM for
example ? The device endianness should be fixed, regardless of the
endianness of the core, no ?

No, it's not an archicture problem. It's a problem specific to that one
SoC that the device was synthetized to be a certain endian while it was
synthetized differently on another SoC... that also happens to be a
different architecture. But doesn't have to.

For example, we had in the past cases of both LE and BE EHCI
implementations on the same architecture (PowerPC).

The runtime overhead is probably non-measurable compared with the cost
of the actual MMIOs.

Cheers,
Ben.
