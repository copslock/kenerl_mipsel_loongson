: Maybe you should talk to them over a crate of Saporro :-)

Next time I go to Japan, I may have to try to do just that :-)
Except, they'd likely want some kind of good saki.  I know that they
are doing NetBSD/arc right now with those machines.  I saw one NEC
machine for sale at a junk shop in Akihabara last time I was there.
Too bad it weighed too much for me to ship it home :-)
