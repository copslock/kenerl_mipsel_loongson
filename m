pwm_{enable,disable,request,free} are the interface of the pwm api. Your pwm-core is
one implementation of that interface. A somewhat special though, because it tries to
be a generic implementation.
There are still other implementations though. For example right now the mips jz4740 one.
In my opinion HAVE_PWM should be defined if there is a implementation for the pwm
interface is available.
I know that your plan is that in the end pwm-core is the only implementation of the
pwm interface.

But right now it is not and on the other hand some SoC implementors might choose that
they want to provide their own minimal pwm interface implementation.
Furthermore this would allow you to start with pwm-core for one SoC which you have on
your desk and where you can properly test things and keep the patches clean from
clutter changing all the different archs.
Once pwm-core is in a proper shape you or other people can start porting all the
different SoC support code to pwm-core.

Similar behavior is for example true for the gpio api. There is gpiolib which is the
generic implementation which allows having gpio chips outside of the chip. On the
other hand there are still archs which choose to have their own gpio api implementation.

Sure. You would create a "struct class" device class for pwm devices. For each
registered pwm device there would then be a "struct device" representing the pwm
device whithin the linux device tree.
This has serveral advantages:
For one you can use this for keeping track of the all the pwm devices instead of
having your custom list. You can use class_for_each_device and class_find_device
instead of traversing your list. This would make the core much simpler and more readable.
Also you can use the device structure for refcounting of modules and devices. Right
now if a pwm-core driver, like the twl6040, is build as a module you can remove the
module while another driver, for example pwm-backlight, is using a pwm device from
the pwm-core driver. Then upon accessing the pwm device from the pwm-backlight driver
the code would crash, because it would access already freed memory.
