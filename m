Does anybody know if there is such a "MIPS PC" machine?  Essentially
I am looking for a machine with MIPS CPU and PC peripherals (such as
SIMM RAM, PCI bus, EIDE HD, VGA graphics, PS/2 mouse/kbd, etc).

It would be really nice to have such a box.  If it is massively produced,
the price should be cheaper than i386 PCs because MIPS CPU price is
much cheaper.
