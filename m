More documentation jewels - I've got now paper copies of R8000 documentation
and a collection of stuff regarding the R6000.  I was told that the R6000
was so buggy that understanding the internal circuitry is a prerequisite
for writing an OS bug now I got everything we need.  Except a R6000
machine :-)

Also I found that there is still a huge pile of Exabyte tapes that have the
final full backup from the day when MIPS Computer Systems, Inc.  was
shutdown by SGI after MIPS got bought in the early 90's.  That means that
provided the legal problems involved with publication of such documentation
get solved we now have everything that is required to support every machine
ever made by MIPS Computer Systems, Inc.
