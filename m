Does anyone have a pointer to somewhere I can DL a big-endian mips linux
statically linked bash binary?  I'm in the process of bringing up the cross
libraries to build one, but since that's going to take a while, I'd like
to get my hands on a preextant binary.

Searching on google/altavista hasn't yielded anything promising.

Any pointers would be appreciated! 
 Thanks, 
  Justin
