I don't like to put words into Ralf's mouth, but it is easier to work 
with patches that have been tested and are ready to go, rather than 
having to re-write everything.


Some of the strings in use are "i686", "x86_64", "octeon", "octeon2", 
"PARISC", "PARISC32", tilegx-m32", "v4l", "v3l", "v4b", and "v3b", these 
last for for ARM and they don't match the GCC -mcpu= values.

So I guess what ever you want.
