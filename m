Subject: [PATCH v2 0/7] Preliminary Platform Driver Support for Lemote Yeeloong Laptops
Date:   Tue,  5 Mar 2019 06:28:41 +0800

v2:
 - Fix the missing io.h header for the MFD driver.

 - Use SIMPLE_DEV_PM_OPS instead of the inappropriate .suspend/resume
   in the SCI driver.

Lemote Yeeloong is a laptop powered by Loongson 2F MIPS processor,
primarily a demo platform for hobbyists and developers. It uses an
ENE KB3310B Embedded Controller with customized firmware to implement
hardware and power management.

Due to the lack of separation of responsibilities and functions between
different subsystems, the original platform driver submitted to the
mailing list was a piece of monolithic module that implements numerous
drivers, as a result, it was never accepted.

This patch series was carefully reorganized and partially reimplemented
to avoid those pitfalls in the original driver. This is the first part
of the submission, which modifies the core MIPS code to introduce
preliminary preparation for other subdrivers. Notably, it leverages a
notify chain and MFD cells to avoid introducing unnecessary code into
the core MIPS subsystem.

It features the following...

* Create a MFD driver for KB3310B controller, and move the original
KB3310B controller code from mips/loongson64 to our new MFD driver.
This needs to be reviewed by the MFD subsystem maintainer before the
following can proceed.

* Add yeeloong_sci driver support of System Control Interrupt to
arch/mips/loongson64/lemote-2f. This piece of code is crucial and
has to be included in loongson64/lemote-2f because it reprograms CS5536
southbridge GPIO to handle the underlying interrupts.

* Originally, the SCI code was mixed into the hotkey driver. The new
yeeloong_sci driver was written to avoid introducing unrelated subdriver
code that is unsuitable for Linux/MIPS. It only handle a minimum set of
core operations directly related to the hardware platform, and pass the
events to other subdrivers via a notifier chain. As a result, the SCI
logic and the specific hotkey handling logic have been decoupled.

* Subdrivers - hwmon, battery, backlight, lcd and hotkey are registered
as MFD cells in the MFD driver. It means onlf the MFD driver is resposible
to register the upcoming subdrivers, the core board files mips/loongson64/
will not contain unrelated code.

I've done everything I can think of to factor unrelated code out of the
MIPS subsystem. I hope the refactored code would be acceptable now. Please
review my changeset to see whether it's appropriate.

Thanks,
