Hi Raj,

I haven't got X running yet, but I'm working on it. My first approach is to
get a simple shadowfb running. I will possibly get this running next weekend
with a fair amount of luck. I'll let the mailing list know when I have
something running.

I need to know how to do DMA transfers before i can archieve a reasonable
speed, unfortunately this is poorly documented. I'm waiting for Robert Tray to
come back from his vacation and tell me how to do it :-)

Regards,
Ulf
