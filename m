* pardon me but...
* Cut the SGI - "We Are Better Than God, Bow Before Our I/O" crap.
*
* Lots of PCs use 10ns SDRAM and 6ns SDRAM all of the time.

Well, I couldn't see anything faster than 60ns on Kingstons store.
http://www.ec.kingston.com/ecom/kepler/specs.asp

*
* Humm, a look at the glossies for the 320 and 540 make it look like all
* of SGI is working off a typo.  It lists:
*    * 100 MHz (50 ns) ECC synchronous dynamic RAM (SDRAM)
* that should read 5ns.  and beyond that, lots of people sell 100Mhz
* capable SDRAM.  (eg http://www.memoryx.com/generic.htm)

I'd guess that their 10ns is a misprint as its cheap and listed in the PC-66
section.


Isn't 100Mhz and 50ns a measure of two different things ? This is meant as a
serious question, as I don't know.  But, I'd guess that one is the refresh and
one the time to access ?

*
* I might buy some if they are competitive w/ plain old white Linux boxes.

How do you measure 'competitive' ? For me, they aren't; for my next-cubicle
neighbour they would be. Luckily we don't live in a one size
(hardware/software) fits all world.
