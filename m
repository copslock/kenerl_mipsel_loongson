Hi,
  i have here a Handheld PC SHARP Telios with MIPS3000 family processor and 
installed a windows CE japanese. My problem is that i want to convert my HPC 
into a linux OS under MIPS family because i cannot understand a japanese 
language, i'm more on english side. This unit is only a gift for me of my 
japanese pal.
Is there any workaround to convert that into a linux? is it possible?. I'm 
basically less knowledge in linux. I hope you can give me some tips and idea 
how to install a linux in my HPC.
I'm very thankfull if you can help me.

Thanks! more power to linux-mips.org!


ROY
