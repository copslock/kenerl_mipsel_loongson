I do some app. development on SGI boxes, and have found that SGI's
Developer Toolbox is a rich resource for hardware and software
information - including an online copy of SGI's Hardware Referece
manual.  You can join SGI's developer program for free by going to
www.sgi.com and following the Developer links.  That will give you
access to all of the goodies I've mentioned above.

I'm interested in your progress in this matter.  SGI's hardware is very
impressive in terms of CPU, buss and I/O performance - it would be
"interesting" to see Linux on an SMP SGI system.

Good Luck!  Uou'll probably need lots of it...   :-)

Cheers,
Lyle
