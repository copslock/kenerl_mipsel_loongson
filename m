Whether the unneeded module can be removed or not, is a side problem
(which I didn't even have in mind at first, thanks for pointing it
out.) The main problem is that, even if you can remove the module, the
device you declared is still visible, even though it's not on the
system - and that's confusing.

What you describe here doesn't fit in the platform device declaration
model. The platform code is supposed to know what hardware is present,
with all the required configuration details. Not being certain that a
given device is there or not, as was the case for your RTC chip, is
already a variation from the standard theme. Being uncertain what chip
is at a given address would be completely off-track IMHO. That would be
much like the PC SMBus' realm where the hardware monitoring chips are
probed automatically, i.e. we do not follow the device driver model at
all. These are the legacy i2c device drivers we are trying to get rid
of at the moment, even though the plan on how to do this is still vague.

Again this would not fit well within the device driver model, as you
would have to load the driver before you know if you really need it.
I agree that we might have to resort to this in some cases (I have
hwmon drivers in mind as I write this.) However, my original idea was
rather to have a single module dedicated to identification of a given
type of I2C devices (say hwmon), that would act as an helper for
i2c-core, letting it instantiate the right I2C devices (in turn
triggering the loading of the appropriate device drivers.)

An alternative would be to delegate the identification task to a
user-space helper. This would however require that new-style I2C
devices can be created and removed from user-space, which isn't the
case yet.

Anyway, I don't expect embedded platforms to need this. That's more
likely to be needed only by hwmon drivers on the PC, and possibly some
old v4l drivers.
