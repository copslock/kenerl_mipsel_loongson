The disk had no label on it. So I had to put it in an external
SCSI-CASE an plug it in (risk). Linux reported an IMB/SGI S6(S8?) or
so. The only model I found was the model S12. Simple Question: Are
both jumper-settings equal? (For the MCA one needs special setting) If
there is no answer for a simple question; not on the web, not after a
call ...

Well, shit happens. Maybe I should have written a mail to someone in
the list directly.
