I have updated my RaQ2 build for Linux from Scratch to most of the 
latest packages for the RaQ2. A question was raised by some other 
memebers of the Linux from Scratch group, that frankly I didn't have the 
answers for. I appreciate your feedback on these questions.

1 - Will the build method I have currently work with any MIPS processor 
based machine, with the exception of the bootloader?

2 - Is there a bootloader for MIPS that will work on every machine, or 
is different for every MIPS based machine's firmware? If so any examples 
out there how to implement?

Thank you for your time and assistance
