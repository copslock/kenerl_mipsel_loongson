I believe I can determine the size of the windows on BRIDGE before hitting the
generic PCI code.  The bridge_probe() function calls register_pci_controller()
at the very bottom, even in the current mainline file (pci-ip27.c), after it's
twiddled a number of BRIDGE register bits.  I'll first have to try and
understand the 'pre_enable' code from the IP30 patch that changes the window
mappings in ip30-bridge.c, then find a way to move that code to execute earlier
before any of the generic PCI code, since it contains some of the logic to size
out the window mappings.

I'll see about getting it to work on IP30 (Octane) first, because all three
window spaces are available without any special magic.  That way, I'll know
what can be done in the generic BRIDGE driver and what needs to happen in
platform-specific files.  That'll make figuring out the IP27 logic a lot
easier....I hope.

I believe so.  The IOTTE stuff in the HUB ASIC on IP27 appears to behave like
an extremely simplified TLB, and once you work out how much space a given PCI
device needs, then you can calculate out the matching Crosstalk address, and
you write that to an unused IOTTE slot.  It doesn't have to be accurate -- each
IOTTE entry needs to be aligned on a 512MB boundary, so once you've set up a
mapping, if another PCI device (or BAR?) needs a Crosstalk address within an
already-mapped boundary, you just point it to the existing IOTTE entry that
matches.

That's my understanding anyways after looking at really old IA64 code in 2.5.70
that used virtually the same hardware when SGI was bringing up the Altix
platform.  Specifically, hub_piomap_alloc() on Line 117 in
Linux-2.5.70/arch/ia64/sn/io/io.c:
https://git.linux-mips.org/cgit/ralf/linux.git/tree/arch/ia64/sn/io/io.c?h=linux-2.5.70

So I just need to make sure all of this happens during the initial
bridge_probe() function, so that everything is ready before calling
register_pci_controller().  We'll find out!

There might be physical limitations on using any kind of PCIe bridge device.
Getting a PCI device into an SGI Octane (IP30) or Origin 2000/Onyx2 (IP27) that
isn't either the BaseIO on IP30 or IO6 on IP27 requires an XIO Shoehorn or PCI
Shoebox.  There's a little bit of leeway on how wide of a PCI card you can
stuff into either one, but it's not much.  I'll have to measure a shoehorn if I
can find one of my spares in a bin someplace.  The Origin 200 tower machine
might let you get away with it...but that's a corner case in my book and not
really worth worrying about it.  It's hard to find one of those completely
intact these days, let alone with a working power supply that doesn't double as
a fireworks display.

Huh, well, I've never actually tried a USB Hub device on my Octane.  If I can
fix PCI up properly and get a 2.0 card to actually work, I'll try it out before
looking too deeply into the Type 1 stuff.

It's unknown why SGI left that much space between the registers on the BRIDGE.
Could've been future-proofing, or maybe there really is a PCI or PCI-X device
out there that currently only works under IRIX that needed it all.  If I can
get things to work better than they are now, I've got a bit of a collection of
PCI devices to test things out with.  Might expose any wrong assumptions.

If you're referring to those uses in ops-bridge.c, that file probably needs
some additional TLC.  The patchset I've got fixed it up a little, but looking
at it made my head hurt (and not just because of the IOC3 voodoo in it), so I
kinda passed on spending too much time on it.  I'll probably have to double
back on it in the future after fixing the other areas, so I'll keep this in mind.

Good to know then.  Hopefully never :)

Well, as I stated earlier above, it looks like the bridge_probe() function in
the new driver will have to do some probing of its own.  One of the patches I
have in a different series does a minimal probe to read each device slot on
BRIDGE to get the vendor ID and device ID to see if the slot is actually
populated.  This is because not all slots are "populated"; e.g., Octane wires
one of the PCI interrupt pins on slot 6 on BaseIO to its power button, for example.

So the logic used to read the vendor/dev IDs can probably be extended to poke
the BARs via the ~0 trick OR read out the pre-defined mappings from ARCS
firmware, then use that info to size out the BRIDGE windows into Crosstalk
space and then set up our IORESOURCE_MEM and IORESOURCE_IO structs with the
right information to pass into register_pci_controller().

I dunno, I'll probably try reading the ARCS mappings idea first, as that seems
easier.  I won't have a lot of time to play with things in March, so getting
something to work, even if it is sub-optimal, is better than nothing working at
all.

This is an issue that the core Linux/MIPS people will have to work out.  Ralf
probably knows the precise history on why ioremap*() and related functions
aren't guaranteed to be usable as virtual addresses.  I suspect it's tied to
the other issues with IP27, as that was one of the first MIPS platforms that
Linux ran on in the early 2000's.

Each window, at least on Octane, lives at distinct addresses in Crosstalk
space.  A specific address within each window can point to the same device on a
subordinate PCI bus, but I think that will be transparent to the Linux PCI
core.  My thinking is, if I setup IORESOURCE_MEM structs for each window for
each BRIDGE widget, then the PCI code will check each struct to see which one
contains the address range that the PCI device's BAR wants.

E.g., Using widget 0xd as an example for readability, if I know my three
windows in Crosstalk space are:
    Small:  0x0000_1d00_0000 - 0x0000_1dff_ffff
    Medium: 0x000e_8000_0000 - 0x000e_ffff_ffff
    Large:  0x00d0_0000_0000 - 0x00df_ffff_ffff

And for that specific BRIDGE, if I pass those three ranges as IORESOURCE_MEM
structs, then shouldn't the PCI core, if it is told that a specific devices BAR
wants range 1d200000 to 1d203fff, select the small window mapping?  E,g., is it
going to try to find the smallest possible window to fit first?  Or will it
instead try to match using the large window?

I guess I'll find out when I can get some time to actually test the idea out...

In an ideal world, this would be correct.  However, owning SGI equipment must
have an effect on the curvature of local spacetime, and things seem to operate
a bit differently.  The IOC3 device is a perfect example of this phenomenon.

I'll keep this in mind when I can start testing.  I'll initially try feeding
three IORESOURCE_MEM structs to the PCI core to describe the three windows in
order from smallest to largest and see what it does.  Then try reversing the
order and see if it still finds the right window or not.  And whether that
actually leads to correct probing of the PCI devices or not.

IMHO, "Use a bigger hammer" seems most appropriate when it comes to this hardware.
