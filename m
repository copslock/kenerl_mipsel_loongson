Linux-mips.org users and mailing list subscribers have noticed it for a
while - the email system was slowing down increasingly and had reached
the point where email as old as from last September was finally delivered
this week though 99%+ of email were being processed much faster.  The
reason for this was the due to another site being down for extended time
a massive backlog of around 2 million emails had piled up on the
linux-mips.org server machine which eventually brought a reasonably
beefy machine running a rather fast mailer daemon to show occasional burn
out syndromes.  I've cleaned out the backlog and mail services should
now hopefully be back to their usual performance.
