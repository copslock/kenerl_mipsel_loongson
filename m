I'm really glad I got such a great response to my message. Everyone's
input is greatly appreciated. 

I'll try and summarize everyones point in another mail as soon as I get a
chance hoping that the "Big Brother" at SGI is listening... 

Until then, here I come Indy... 

(Although wouldn't it be nice to be able to have IU ask for Linux the 
 next time they decide to add more nodes to there Cray Origin 2000. I
 mean, we could always just use that Intel Paragon we have sitting in 
 the cornere)  ;-)
