I tested few older kernels, and it seems that the spurious IRQ issue has
been always there after switching to libata (commit 7ff7a5b1bfff). It has
been unnoticed as the 100000 irq limit wasn't reached during boot. But
since libata probe is asynchronous some other kernel thread may delay it,
and apparently some change in recent kernels adds enough delay to make the
IRQ count to hit the limit.

This hack works only for CONFIG_PATA_CS5536. You are probably using PATA_AMD.
