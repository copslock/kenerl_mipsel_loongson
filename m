       Yes, the MIPS systems were sold with an OS license (for use on that
machine).  The license includes UNIX and NFS licenses.

       I believe that the 3230 and 3240 used QIC-150, but I think some
M/120 systems had only QIC-120.  (The QIC-150 reads both kinds of cartridge,
but the QIC-120 of course cannot read the QIC-150 tape.)
