Ok I have a older Indy box here and I was wondering what I need to do to get
this thing running Linux.  From what I understand you have to have Irix
already installed on it.  Unfortunently we just threw a new harddrive in
with nothing on it and we don't have a copy of Irix.  Is there anyway to
install Linux on this badboy from scratch?  I'm willing to help our with
making binary package's ect if I can just get this thing booting into linux!
Any ideas, cd's ect?
