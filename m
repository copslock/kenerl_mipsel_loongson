Wow, that's a pretty high bar ;-)  Better IMHO to try for something that=20
seems to make rational sense, then let others convert it into something=20
that makes less sense afterwards, if necessary ;-)

After looking around the tree to find out where similar code is located,=20
it looks like drivers/firmware is the right place.  These days,=20
drivers/firmware is mainly used for drivers that parse EFI bootloader=20
data, DMI data, that sort of thing.  Quite similar to the CFE-provided=20
data that the bcm47xx-nvram code deals with.  So, by functional analogy,=20
drivers/firmware appears to be the right place to stash this device=20
data-probing code.

Yep, based on what the other drivers in drivers/firmware are used for, I=20
think drivers/firmware is the right place for the CFE parsing code.

OK.

So (as a side issue), I would suggest that when you move this code out of=
=20
arch/mips, the MIPS-isms in it should be removed, like KSEG1ADDR(), etc.,=
=20
and replaced by the standard ioremap()-type approach.  After all, Broadcom=
=20
could build CFE for ARM, and then we'd want to use this same code to parse=
=20
the CFE-provided data.

Also I would suggest getting rid of the #ifdefs for the flash type, and=20
probing it dynamically instead.  The flash setup code under drivers/ssb/=20
and drivers/bcma/ sets up platform_devices for the flash, right?  If so=20
then it would be best if this code could run after the bus setup code,=20
query the Linux device model for the type of platform flash in use, and=20
then extract the appropriate address space to probe from that data.

Thanks for the correction, I must have been dreaming of telecom=20
equipment..

What do you think?  Does this sound reasonable?
