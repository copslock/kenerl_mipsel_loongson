   Safe mode is defined as the mode not faster than the slowest drive's 
fastest mode.

    But why do you think that the PIO mode being programmed is actually 
safer for another drive than previous one which might have been slower?

   Hm, that corresponds to 30 MHz and 6.7x that one for 200 MHz. But why 
100 ns turns into 1 us then? Well, not that it actually matters much, 
just for consistency...

   I.e. when you're performing PIO transfer with drive but have 
programmed the controller for DMA transfer -- IIUC, TX4939 supports 
that. Otherwise these "break" bits don't make sense...

   Aren't you masking it already?

   I suggest pr_err() or pr_warning() here and dropping it in the 
dma_end() method.

   Ah, you're now using it in the tf_load() method...

   Frankly speaking, I couldn't make out much of tht passage:

<CAUSION>
The write to the register by the Device/Head register may cause an 
unexpected function by write wrong
data to the register. So please rewrite to the System Control register 
after write to the Device/Head
register to secure write to System Control register in ATA100 Core.

   For the curious, the datasheet is here:
