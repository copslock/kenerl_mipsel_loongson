Well... I don't really like the idea of running one driver and
subsystem implementation on completely distinct types of silicon.
We will end up with the same mess that broadcom ended up with in
their "SB" code (broadcom's SSB backplane implementation).
For example, in their code the driver calls pci_enable_device() and
related PCI functions, even if there is no PCI device at all. The calls
are magically re-routed to the actual SB backplane.
You'd have to do the same mess with SSB. Calling ssb_device_enable()
will mean "enable the SSB device", if the backplane is SSB, and will
mean "enable the HND/AI" device, if the backplane is HND/AI.

So I'm still in favor of doing a separate HND/AI bus implementation,
even if
that means duplicating a few lines of code. I think that compared to the
workarounds and conditionals needed for getting SSB to run on HND/AI
hardware, it will be a net win.

SSB doesn't search for SSB busses in the system, because there's no
way to do so. The architecture (or the PCI/PCMCIA/SDIO device) registers
the bus,
if it detected an SSB device. So for the embedded case, it's hardcoded
in the arch code. For the PCI case it simply depends on the PCI IDs.
I don't see a problem here. Your arch code will already have to know
what machine it is running on. So it will have to decide whether to
register a SSB or HND/AI bus.

It's like a platform_device. However, it doesn't use the platform_device
mechanism. There's no technical reason. It would be trivial to port the
SSB bus registration to use platform_device, however.

Sure. The code needs to be cleaned up and moved to the mainline kernel
_anyway_. You don't get around this.
