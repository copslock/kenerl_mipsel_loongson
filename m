This was missing, due to some oh-so-clever things I'd done while
transferring the libs onto the Indy.

All is better now, and I've built apache. =)
Once I find a pristine source archive of the net-tools (proving

Does anyone have a penguin-plus-SGI-cube logo yet, or should I get
someone here to whip it up? =)
