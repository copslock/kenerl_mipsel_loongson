Right.  However I think bootbus.txt, ciu.txt, dma-engine.txt and
uctl.txt may continue to live under devicetree/bindings/mips/cavium as
they don't really have an existing category.

OK I added the "cavium," part.  I want to keep the name suffixes as
they are, as they correspond exactly to the terminology in the
Hardware Reference Manuals.

How about something like this:


* Boot Bus

The Octeon Boot Bus is a configurable parallel bus with 8 chip
selects.  Each chip select is independently configurable.

Properties:
- compatible: "cavium,octeon-3860-bootbus"

   Compatibility with all cn3XXX, cn5XXX and cn6XXX SOCs.

- reg: The base address of the Boot Bus' register bank.

- #address-cells: Must be <2>.  The first cell is the chip select
    within the bootbus.  The second cell is the offset from the chip select.

- #size-cells: Must be <1>.

- ranges: There must be one one triplet of (child-bus-address,
   parent-bus-address, length) for each active chip select.  If the
   length element for any triplet is zero, the chip select is disabled,
   making it inactive.

The configuration parameters for each chip select are stored in child
nodes.

Configuration Properties:
- compatible:  "cavium,octeon-3860-bootbus-config"

- cavium,cs-index: A single cell indicating the chip select that
   corresponds to this configuration.

- cavium,t-adr: A cell specifying the ADR timing (in nS).

- cavium,t-ce: A cell specifying the CE timing (in nS).

- cavium,t-oe: A cell specifying the OE timing (in nS).

- cavium,t-we: A cell specifying the WE timing (in nS).

- cavium,t-rd-hld: A cell specifying the RD_HLD timing (in nS).

- cavium,t-wr-hld: A cell specifying the WR_HLD timing (in nS).

- cavium,t-pause: A cell specifying the PAUSE timing (in nS).

- cavium,t-wait: A cell specifying the WAIT timing (in nS).

- cavium,t-page: A cell specifying the PAGE timing (in nS).

- cavium,t-rd-dly: A cell specifying the RD_DLY timing (in nS).

- cavium,pages: A cell specifying the PAGES parameter (0 = 8 bytes, 1
   = 2 bytes, 2 = 4 bytes, 3 = 8 bytes).

- cavium,wait-mode: Optional.  If present, wait mode (WAITM) is selected.

- cavium,page-mode: Optional.  If present, page mode (PAGEM) is selected.

- cavium,bus-width: A cell specifying the WIDTH parameter (in bits) of
   the bus for this chip select.

- cavium,ale-mode: Optional.  If present, ALE mode is selected.

- cavium,sam-mode: Optional.  If present, SAM mode is selected.

- cavium,or-mode: Optional.  If present, OR mode is selected.

You did ask, I forget if I answered.

Within the CIU there is really no concept of high and low.  They are
just bits in some registers, and the interrupt handling code knows how
to deal with them.

Interrupt lines that leave the chip are specified in the
cavium,octeon-3860-gpio controller below, and do have edge/level
high/low configuration there.

Right.  I don't know what it is yet.

I put the 2nd. cell there because "fsl,mpc8347-gpio" has it.

There are programmable glitch filters, signal inversion and several
other parameters that may need to be set, but I am not sure the best
way to specify that.
