Right off the bat, let me express my whole-hearted agreement with James
& the question he asked in that quote. If there is a good reason for
some things to be one large driver then we can discuss that, but so far I
don't believe anybody has given one - nobody replied to James' mail that
you quote [1].

It looks to me like in 2009 someone did the work to split the driver up,
which shows that it's possible, but the drivers were placed under
arch/mips which is not where they belong. They should individually be
placed at the right points under drivers/, and submitted to the relevant
subsystem maintainers.

To address the particular quote you give from Dmitry Torokhov on the
yeeloong_hotkey driver - just because the driver as-is includes a bunch
of non-input related things doesn't mean that it should or has to. From
a look at the 2009 submission it seems to mix a bunch of policy into the
kernel which really ought to be elsewhere. Generally the input driver
reports that a key was pressed & something in userland decides what to
do with it, whereas this driver seems to attempt to bypass that & prod
at unrelated hardware all by itself.

Anyone watching will have noticed that Ralf was only intermittently
active for quite a while, and has more recently he's been absent due to
ill health. Correspondingly there was a time when patches sent to
linux-mips didn't go anywhere quickly. Towards the end of 2017 James
Hogan stepped up & things started moving again, and more recently I've
been maintaining arch/mips/. The number of patches being applied has
increased, the frequency of pull requests has increased & stopped being
so last minute, and hopefully responses on the mailing list have become
more regular.

So if unmerged arch/mips/ patches are holding you up, ping me, but
preferrably make sure code being added actually belongs under arch/mips/
first.

On Loongson patches in particular there's a recurring theme in which
patches are submitted, review comments are provided, they're ignored &
the patches are later submitted again without addressing the review
comments. That's not universally true of all Loongson-related patches,
but there are plenty of examples of it. Of course when resubmitted the
patches still don't get merged, because they still have unaddressed
problems.

The seeming lack of documentation for particular Loongson-based
machines, lack of English documentation for the CPU cores & lack of
detailed errata information all contribute to difficulties too. For a
recent example see the loongson_llsc_mb() workaround currently in the
mips-fixes branch - we got there in the end but it took a surprising
amount of back & forth effort to obtain enough information about what
the CPU bug actually is.

I want to be clear that I absolutely want Linux to have good support for
Loongson hardware, but that doesn't mean I'll merge things before
they're of sufficient quality & it doesn't mean I'll try to merge things
that really belong under the care of other maintainers.

Personally I see no reason for that hwmon driver to live under
drivers/platform/mips rather than drivers/hwmon. All that does is bypass
the attention of the drivers/hwmon/ maintainers who would be best placed
to offer input & ensure the driver is actually any good.

I think that question should prompt another - if we have maintainers for
various driver subsystems, why not place the drivers under their care in
the already established directories?

I can't speak to Google's intentions or methods, but would expect the
procedure to be approximately:

  1) Have a generally agreed upon good reason for the new directory.

  2) Have someone willing & able to maintain it, preferrably with a good
     track record of contributions to the kernel.

  3) Ideally submit it for inclusion in linux-next.

  4) Send a pull request to Linus.

  5) Wait & see if he accepts or says no.

I think this particular case falls down at step 1.

Thanks,
    Paul
