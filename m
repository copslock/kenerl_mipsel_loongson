Subject: Anyone send a binary r4600 no L2 cache kernel ?

As the subject suggests, I'm having problems setting up a proper
cross-compilation environment due to many factors (like its not even my
box, very screwed IRIX installation etc).

While I'm sure I can work this out in a few days, if someone has a
relatively stable kernel binary for the r4600 that has _NO_ L2 cache, this
would be great if you could email it to me. 

Perhaps putting a binary up on the ftp site would be a good idea as it
would be a big help to those who, like me, only have access to a L2
cacheless system.

Thanks
