http://www.mips.com/devTools/devArea/Linux.html states "The MIPS Linux
kernel is available based on both 2.2.12 and 2.4 releases, and is provided
as a reference for developers using Linux in a system based on a MIPS
Technologies core. It supports MIPS32 and MIPS64 CPUs..." Why are people
grabbing 2.2.12? Don't know, but 2.4 is available at
ftp://ftp.mips.com/pub/linux/mips/kernel/2.4/. Additional info is available
up a couple levels at ftp://ftp.mips.com/pub/linux/mips/. Enjoy...
