I know I'm being a pain in the ass, but...

I'm really, really stuck.  I'd love to help build packages, but I can't
because my libc is old and out of date.

Great, I thought, I'll just cross compile my libc.  Except I'm back to
where I was in August.  I can't for the life of me cross compile anything,
especially the kernel.  I know I'm not using the correct gcc. I don't know
where the correct patches are. And I'm frustrated. And I know that libc is
the only thing I'm missing.

Can someone _please_ break my cycle by uploading their functional libc?
Please? If I get it, and can become a productive member of society again.
