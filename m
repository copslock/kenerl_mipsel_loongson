Hi,

I am trying to set-up cygwin tool chain (gcc, gdb,
gc++) on my Windows 98 for targets: ARM7 (EP7312) &
MIPS (ATLAS- 4Kc). This is get ecos running on these
platforms.

Is there free GNU tools (gcc,gdb, gc++) available for
these platforms on the net that can be used to build
ecos?
If so, please help me find them & install them &
sucessfuly build ecoa… This is just for serious hobby
purpose.

when responding cc to my ID: michaelanburaj@yahoo.com

Thanks a lot,
-Mike.
