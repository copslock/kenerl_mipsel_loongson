Well, it seems the connection today is rather good :), thus I'm
downloading the Hard Hat as well and will try it on my little Indy 
(100 MHZ R4000 with 32MB RAM and two disks: 500MB and 2GB). 

I work at the Bogolyubov Institute for Theoretical Physics 
in Kiev, Ukraine, and use my Indy for numerical simulations 
and visualisation of obtained data. But even 100 MHZ Pentium under 
Linux runs faster! I very hope that SGI/Linux can change the 
situation... Many thanks for it!
