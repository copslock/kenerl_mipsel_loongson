I am unable to test it on such a short notice as I'm currently ill, so I
cannot tell if your change breaks the OMAP3/AM335x boards or not. Given
that there are very few CI20 boards in use, I'd like to ask you for some
extra time to investigate this on the OMAP3 too.

btw what strikes me as curious is that this patch emerged shortly after
Ezequiel re-posted the CI20 U-Boot patches after an year-long hiatus, is
it somehow related ?
