Hello,

	How about R10000 on O2 ? are you working on that aswell?
	Do you have or know where to get documentation of O2's hardware,
	I've opened mine up, the only thing I was able to recognize were
	two Adaptec 7880P controllers (if I recall the model number
	correctly),  could you point me to some place which has docs?

	Thanks,
		Marc Esipovich.
