it wont work on mt7620 but on mt7628 which is a subtype on mt7620. both
share the soc_mt7620.c inside arch/mips/ralink/ we rely on runtime
detection between the 2 and on the dts loading the correct driver.

mt7620 and mt7628 are both hidden behind the SOC_MT7620 symbol. the
ï»¿depends on SOC_MT7620 part is correct and working. but i agree, just
drop it, i will simply carry it around with us in openwrt. one driver
more wont make a difference.
