I don't think seccomp nesting (at kernel level) has any value.

First, syscalls are wrong level of abstraction for sandboxing. There
are multiple ways to read from file, for example.

If you wanted to do hierarchical sandboxes, asking your monitor to
restrict your seccomp mask would seem like a way to go...
