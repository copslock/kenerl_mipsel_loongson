You can do what the rest of us have been doing for years.
If you don't like it, take the time to fix it and submit the updates.
Although it is nice to get this for free and some people actually
get paid to work on it, some of us have spent countless hours
of our own time providing what you see today.  Step up and
help or stop complaining.

If you have actually paid for software from one of the
commercial vendors you mentioned, work with their support
staff to get your problems resolved.

Thanks.
