Hello all,

Please pardon the newbie question, but I was wondering what a kernel in 
general expects a monitor program/bootloader like YAMON to do for it 
beforehand, if anything at all. I know the answer is very board specific, 
but if there are any generic things that a kernel expects ready for it 
before it starts running (caches initialized already? SDRAM control regs set 
up? Or maybe the kernel has no expectations at all?), I'd be grateful if 
someone could point them out.

TIA,
-S.
