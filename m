Well in most cases it is not masked ROM, but rather some sort of 
persistent but modifiable storage.  But still getting people (both 
internal and external) to update it is not as easy as living with the 
status quo.  The idea is that someone should be able to get a kernel.orq 
kernel and use it, without having to re-flash their board's bootloader.
