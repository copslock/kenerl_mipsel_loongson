This linux@engr.sgi.com mailing list is for those of us at SGI
who believe Linux is a good thing that we shouldn't ignore or
even better: do something proactive about it.

As a first step we would like to see a port of Linux to the MIPS
architecture happen.  A mailing list of the interested people
may accelerate this process by bringing the right people together.

If you no longer wish to receive this list, send the following to
linux-request@relay.engr.sgi.com:

	unsubscribe linux

Ariel Faigon (ariel@engr) is the owner of this list.
Happy Linuxing.
