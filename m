Hi,

I was talking to my manager and she agreed to make the documentation for the
Indy public.  The location is:

	oss.sgi.com /pub/linux/mips/doc/indy

I think everything is there except for the HAL2 specification that I wasn't
able to find and some PBUS documentation that I wasn't able to convert.  I
will give that one another try..

Ulf
