C'mon Pete, it's obviously a typo!   It predates my involvement
with the code - hell, I never even knew that "Nevada" was the
QED code name for the R5200 family before I started hacking
on the MIPS Linux kernel, even though I had an R5230 system
in my lab.  The "6" is probably shifted left one position from 
"R5260", which was, I believe, the first chip of the Nevada
family to ship.
