Welcome back Jonas - and thanks for reviewing :-)

According to my cheat sheet, BCM6328 has the newer BMIPS4355 core,
which includes the "DMA" features used for prefetching packet data.
BCM6368 has the old BMIPS4350.

On some of the BCM7xxx kernels there is a timer peripheral that always
runs at 27 MHz.  It is used to derive the CPU frequency at runtime, so
no hardcoding is necessary:

https://github.com/BlackPole/vuplus-kernel/blob/master/arch/mips/brcmstb/time.c#L119

On a generic BMIPS kernel it might be harder to rely on an external timer.

Is there a better solution (or should we implement some sort of
fallback if the mips-hpt-frequency property is missing)?

I don't know the 435x's very well, but I believe all BMIPS CPUs allow
selecting between 1:1, 1:2, 1:4, and 1:8.  BMIPS5000 also allows 1:16.

FWIW, this feature is unstable on several of the 40nm chips.

Also, some older versions of the core (65nm, 130nm) scaled down the
MIPS CP0 counter frequency when the base clock changed.  The newer
BMIPS438x cores, and all BMIPS5000 cores, do not.  CP0 $22,0 bit 6 on
BMIPS438x should be '1' if the counter frequency is fixed.  Not sure
about BMIPS435x.

We will have to put some thought into implementing cpufreq in a generic way...

Honestly I'd prefer to nuke them from the bindings doc.  But
checkpatch was complaining that they were undocumented.

Any opinions?

So, our options include:

1) Use a bool option for each one; leave the setup.c heuristic logic
in place.  Multiplatform kernels still work with existing bootloaders.
Need a bunch of new #ifdefs in this section of code.

2) Use a choice option to allow one DTS file (or no DTS file) to be compiled in.

3) Forbid compiling in DTS files; make people use a sensible
bootloader or wrapper.

4) Leave everything as-is.

The short term plan can be different from the long term plan.

What does everyone prefer?

No preference either way.  Should we stick with the ARM convention, or
use a more unique magic number?

I suspect that if somebody is motivated to support the older chips in
arch/mips/bmips, our setup.c will start borrowing the existing bcm63xx
logic.

OTOH this could also be an opportunity to drop obsolete platforms that
have a small number of users or a large number of hacks.

How unfortunate.  A lot of effort/persuasion went into standardizing
this format on STB.

I can change this to use a value/mask test for non-STB?

My 6328 says:

# devmem 0x10000000
0x632830B0

Will need to double check our 6329's (I think their upper halfword is
still 0x6328).

Good idea.  My current line of thinking is to restructure quirks into
its own table, indexed by the compatible string.

I saw other platforms passing in strings like "lantiq,falcon" and did
likewise...

I can experiment with removing that bus registration entirely to see
what happens.

That looks like a goof.  There is code in setup.c that knows whether
to enable/disable CPU1 on 6328 based on OTP.  Will fix.

I have no preference either way, but
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mips/cpu_irq.txt has the "@0".

If you aren't putting any IRQs on CPU1 you can probably get away with
only mentioning the status register once, for now.

irq-bcm7120-l2.c will need some additional work before it can handle
multiple CPUs.
