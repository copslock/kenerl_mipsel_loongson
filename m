I know this question is probably asked alot.
I tried looking at some of the mailing list archives.
I wanted to know if it is possible to install Linux on SGI 02 R5000's
I noticed there was support for R5000s, but not for R5000 that had CPU-controlled secondary
cache.  I couldnt figure out how to find out if the 02 I have is one or the other.
