We're getting a whole pile of SGI hardware in to `kick the tires' over
the next 6 months, and I'm wondering which of them I should claim as
my test box.

I can likely choose an Indy, an Indigo, possibly one of the Webforce
boxes (I assume it's similar hardware to the Indigo) and, if I beg and
plead and offer beer, a Challenge-S.

Has an initial port target been designated?
