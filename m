please respond off list with any replies. i thank the list for it's
indulgence, but i have purchased another Indy with more options, and i don't
need two, so i'm selling the first one i bought.

it's a nice machine and boots into what ever that first screen is called
after making the horn music.

there is no Irix installed. I haven't gotten any software cds from ebay yet.
