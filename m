I have some general questions for all:

How many of you are involved with embedded linux development using a
MIPS processor? 

What endianess have you chosen for your project and why? 

If you have not guessed it, I am involved with a MIPS/Linux embedded
project and we are trying to determine if there are any pros or cons in
one endianess over the other.
