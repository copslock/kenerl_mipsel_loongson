FWIW, there's a _lot_ of interest at my company in having one OS that
runs on all our boxes (Intel, SP*RC, Alpha, now MIPS), and Linux is
the preferred choice.  The reasons don't necessarily have anything
to do with disliking the native OS (except for Solaris, perhaps), but
we _would_ like:
- common file structure and apps
- source compatibility
- access to source for the firewall machines

If the Solaris binary compatibility was up to hosting Oracle and the
Netscape WWW servers[*], we'd probably have already gone that route on
all but the 4d monster.

I know that having Linux on SGI hardware would make it much easier to
`sell' it into our environment, which includes solutions we deliver to
clients.  (And I don't get to make all that many purchasing
decisions. =) )

[*] At the DevCon last week, the question of support for Linux was
raised at the executive Q&A panel.  There was a show of hands, and a
_lot_ of people in the audience were interested in seeing SuiteSpot on
Linux; Netscape's asked me to write them a little paper explaining why
`people who aren't willing to pay for Linux would be willing to pay
for SuiteSpot', and I'll send a copy around here when it's done.
