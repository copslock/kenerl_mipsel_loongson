    It's also write-only on TC86C001, and the original driver (as well as 
mine) cleared it explicitly.

    Anyway, the TX3939 datasheet says that sector size must be a multiple of 
256 words when transferring more than 1 sector.

    At least it worked with a CD-ROM for me. :-)

    Hum, let me think... worth printing a message if this happens.

    Which is not its business to test. I think you should remove that above 
check -- if there's INTRQ asserted, then it's asserted. I wonder if BMIDE 
interrupt bit gets set in that case (suspecting it's not)...

    I meant the typo. :-)

   Yeah, that totally useless flag...

    Hum, then I wonder why it's MIPS specific...

    I mean that in LE mode you're using ide_read_sff_dma_status() but not 
setting hwif->dma_base, so it won't work. But since it shouldn't be called in 
this driver's case, this doesn't hurt.
