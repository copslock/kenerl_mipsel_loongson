Don't get me wrong.  I'm not opposed to Linux on SGI.  In fact, I'm in favor
of it, at least on some set of systems.  I don't believe that Linux on 64P
O2000s makes a lot of sense yet, but I think it would be nice to have Linux
running on O200s and Indys.

Personally, I wouldn't buy an O2 to run Linux.
