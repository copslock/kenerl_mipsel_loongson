Why would you disable FIFO to clear it ? This doesn't make sense to me,
the FIFO must be operational for it to be cleared. Moreover, it
contradicts your previous statement, "the programming example it gives
says to explicitly clear the FIFOs using FCR[2:1]" .

What exactly does your programming example for the JZ4780 say about the
FIFO clearing ? And does it work in that example ?

Does your platform need the FIFO to be explicitly disabled for it to be
cleared, can you confirm that ? And if so, does this apply to other
platforms with 8250 UART or is this specific to JZ4780 implementation of
the UART block ?

I just remembered U-Boot has this patch for JZ4780 UART [1], which
touches the FCR UME bit, so the FCR behavior on JZ4780 does differ from
the generic 8250 core. Could it be that this is what you're hitting ?

Uhh, OK, thanks for clarifying.
