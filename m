I think using current should be enough here? Anyway in all other cases 
where syscall_get_arch is used, any other methods that require a task 
pointer take it from current as well.

And as it happens I think it works on all archs that have COMPAT and 
that pose any problems here? So for any arch that doesn't support 
syscall_get_arch it should be safe to have a fallback that defaults to 
indicating a single arch type.

However, it seems to me that the method used currently for mapping the 
syscall metadata to the syscall numbers wouldn't be possible when the 
extra dimension of arch type is added? Would it require some sort of 
metadata pointer table generation at build time?
If all archs used the same method for building syscall tables (as 
suggested by Arnd) then we could have a single build-time method for 
adding the syscall metadata map to the syscall tables? (as all the 
symbol names are known at that time and could be coalesced to find the 
metadata location from a syscall number/arch and name)...
