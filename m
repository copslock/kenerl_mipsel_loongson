OK.

Sure, makes sense.

Due to trailing zeroes, I suppose. :)

Thank you for these tips. Eventually I'd like to make use of kernel tracing
features, BPF (MIPS JIT seems to require a 64 bit kernel though), dynamic
debug, etc.

Serial I/O requires soldering for the PS2. JÃ¼rgen Urban, Rick Gaiser, and
others have it and they can more easily debug the early boot stages. The
proposed PS2 serial driver uses a 20 ms timer and polling instead of SIOInt:

https://github.com/frno7/linux/blob/ps2-v4.15-n7/drivers/tty/serial/ps2-uart.c

I don't have a serial port. My setup consists of ssh over a wireless RT3070*
USB device. Obviously a great number of things could potentially fail in
that chain but it is surprisingly reliable. :)

* A few hardcoded DMA buffer sizes in the RT3070 driver have to be made
  smaller since PS2 IOP DMA memory is limited to 256 KiB. It would be nice
  if USB drivers could adjust themselves to the amount of available memory,
  or make it configurable.
