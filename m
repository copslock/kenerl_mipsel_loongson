Subject: [PATCH v3 00/11] Provide generic top-down mmap layout functions
Date:   Wed, 17 Apr 2019 01:22:36 -0400

This series introduces generic functions to make top-down mmap layout
easily accessible to architectures, in particular riscv which was
the initial goal of this series.
The generic implementation was taken from arm64 and used successively
by arm, mips and finally riscv.

Note that in addition the series fixes 2 issues:
- stack randomization was taken into account even if not necessary.
- [1] fixed an issue with mmap base which did not take into account
  randomization but did not report it to arm and mips, so by moving
  arm64 into a generic library, this problem is now fixed for both
  architectures.

This work is an effort to factorize architecture functions to avoid
code duplication and oversights as in [1].

Changes in v3:
  - Split into small patches to ease review as suggested by Christoph
    Hellwig and Kees Cook
  - Move help text of new config as a comment, as suggested by Christoph
  - Make new config depend on MMU, as suggested by Christoph

Changes in v2 as suggested by Christoph Hellwig:
  - Preparatory patch that moves randomize_stack_top
  - Fix duplicate config in riscv
  - Align #if defined on next line => this gives rise to a checkpatch
    warning. I found this pattern all around the tree, in the same proportion
    as the previous pattern which was less pretty:
    git grep -C 1 -n -P "^#if defined.+\|\|.*\\\\$" 

Alexandre Ghiti (11):
  mm, fs: Move randomize_stack_top from fs to mm
  arm64: Make use of is_compat_task instead of hardcoding this test
  arm64: Consider stack randomization for mmap base only when necessary
  arm64, mm: Move generic mmap layout functions to mm
  arm: Properly account for stack randomization and stack guard gap
  arm: Use STACK_TOP when computing mmap base address
  arm: Use generic mmap top-down layout
  mips: Properly account for stack randomization and stack guard gap
  mips: Use STACK_TOP when computing mmap base address
  mips: Use generic mmap top-down layout
  riscv: Make mmap allocation top-down by default
