There is even more going on this week.  The DECstation guys have managed
to run their first user task, Thomas managed to get X up on the Magnum 4000 /
Olivetti.  I'd say a pretty good week.

Having done enough packaging work myself I know what pain you had to go
through and I'd like to thank you in the name of us all.  Having the first
reasonle difficult to install distribution is a quantum leap in every
Linux port's history.

Time to put up a webpage and register users :-)
