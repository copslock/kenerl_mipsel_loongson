Looking more at this posting, a blank line has been inserted into the
headers, thereby turning some of the headers into a part of the body.
This also explains why we saw this `3D' things sprinkled all over
Steven's posting.  This is not a bug I've observed before with
MS Outlaw which Steven is using and our Majorodom also shouldn't be
guilty.  Would leave the somewhat older version of Zmailer we're running
on oss as one of the suspects.

Matti,

have you ever seen blank lines inserted like this?
