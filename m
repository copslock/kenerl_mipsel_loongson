It's my website, so if these get moved, I can update the link.

What do you mean it gets active on pwm_disable()? If pwm_disable() gets=20
called
the PWM line goes back to inactive state, which is what it should do.

So it switches to full ON as soon as I set the duty cycle to 5s. Same=20
for
the polarity, it is updated as soon as the register is written. So the
registers are not shadowed.

 From what I can see, with "abrupt" shutdown the line will always=20
return to
its inactive state (be it low or high, depending on the polarity).=20
Setting
this bit to "graceful" shutdown, the only difference is that the=20
hardware
will keep its current state, active or inactive. That's why we use the
"abrupt" shutdown in the PWM driver.

OK.
