Which only contributes to my confusion, I have no clue how these 
machines compare.

Not that I'm claiming in any way to have the skills nor the time: what 
are the issues involved?

I stumbled uppun some documentation on Andrew Clausen working on 
supporting Origin 200 earlier this year. He wrote a small howto on some 
of the quirks involved in shoving a Linux kernel onto one of those 
beasts.

http://members.optusnet.com.au/clausen/sgi/LINUX-IP27-HOWTO

He has some utils and some info on getting it running, what is your 
take? Will this get my anywhere near having a running Linux on my 
Ocane? Or do I have to start kernel-hacking before that will happen =]?
