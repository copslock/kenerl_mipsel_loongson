I'm not seeing any binding documentation in here but there's OF
bindings - any new device tree bindings should have documentation
attached.

Can you use regmap_mmio?  Not that it makes much difference, really -
it's totally unimportant, just something to consider.

Obviously it'd be nice if this were only done during SPI transfers,
currently the module is enabled whenever the driver is loaded.  Again
just something to consider.

I can't help but think that there's some stuff here that ought to be
factored out for bitbanging controllers, but it's not that important.

Just remove empty functions - if the function is mandatory it at least
needs an explanation as to why your driver doesn't need to do anything.

This is very suspicious - why is this being done based on the machine
rather than based on the IP?  Surely there can be machines with this SoC
on which aren't compatible with whatever (reference?) board this is
matching on.  I'd expect that the driver would have multiple compatible
strings which it uses to distinguish the capabilities of the IP.

Though actually the driver never reads this value so perhaps the code
can just be deleted and we rely on the fact that if the /CS isn't
physically present nobody's going to hook it up on a board so just
always set it to 6?

dev_info().
