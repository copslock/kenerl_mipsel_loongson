    I was just browsing this week's Info World, which includes
their "1997 Product of the Year" awards.  They gave the Operating
System award to Red Hat Linux, and the Best Technical Support
award to the Linux user community.  They wrote, "Find out what
you have been missing while you've been rebooting Windows NT", and,
in regard to support from commercial vendors, "Many times [the vendors]
deny that there are bugs in their software."
