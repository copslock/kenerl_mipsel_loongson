Hi James,

This patch also solved my problem with VDSO on the Lantiq VR9 SoC.

Could you please send this as a patch for inclusion into the Linux
mainline kernel and also mark it for backporting to to stable.

We deactivated VDSO gettimeofday support for MIPS in LEDE because of
this bug. With VDSO support a ping would show wrong numbers in about 5%
to 50% of the cases on affected SOCs.
