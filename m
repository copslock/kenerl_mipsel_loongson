This was only an RFC.  The whole patch set needs at least one more 
revision to synchronize it with my boards' u-boot changes.

I will post another set soon, and perhaps that can go via Ralf's tree.

No.  They are all internal to the SOC and cannot be changed.  The chip 
IRQ code knows how to deal with them.

Yes, they are clearly documented as two banks.

OK.  I will use those still somewhat arbitrary values instead.
