Normally if you're resending other people's patches they should be sent
out with your email in the email's From: header and with the patch
author's name and Email address in a From: line in the first (important,
otherwise git won't parse it right) of the body.  Somehow here Hillf
ended up in the From: header which may be confusing, might upset him
and might also trigger spam filters.

No need to resend but you may want to fix that for the next batch of
patches.
