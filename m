Hi Linuxies

As you may know, David Miller's arival is really close now.
Larry says this Friday...

We reserved Matisse in 9U, for this Wednesday for a one
hour meeting.

The goal is to try and see what we have ready for David
and see how can we improve our preparedness in the last
days that remain.

David: do you have names for the two hosts by now?
Bill: do you have 200MHz CPUs?
I understand we were short on our promises to pre-prepare
stuff since people were really busy, any good news would be nice.

Peace, Ariel
