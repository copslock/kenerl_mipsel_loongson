I'm owning a DECStation mentioned in the subject. It has
only one flaw: The Firmware-EPROM of the on-board PMAD-AA
Ethernet adapter has become amnesic. So is there anyone who
can read out his EPROM and send me an image so that I can
finally boot Linux from the net? The version was 5.3a

Many Thanks in advance
Armin
