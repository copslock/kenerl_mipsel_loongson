Hi all, 

I just wanted to make something certain, b4 I went and banged my head all
the way, about linux ports for SGI h/w.

I have recently acquired a 100Mhz R4K indigo .. would mips/linux work on
this, as this is a r4k machine .. ( I would presume the kernel should
work, while the device drivers may not ) ..

if yes, is there something else I need to do to make that happen .. if not
can I hack my way into making that happen.

If hacking is possible, then could somebody send me some pointers .. since
what I want to work on, is the Xserver ..

Thanx
