No #ifdefs required until we drop the deprecated helpers, which will
inevitably happen, even if only in several years. So in practice,
#ifdefs would be required for out-of-tree drivers (or semi-out-of-tree
drivers such as v4l/dvb drivers).

That's tempting, but see below.

I agree that the i2c-dev.h mess needs some love and this is on my to-do
list for this year. That's not necessarily related to the problem at
hand though.

Whether it's in the kernel or outside the kernel is irrelevant. The
developers are likely to be the same, and the person who will have to
deal with the confusion is the same (i.e.: me.)

I'm not going to take this, sorry. I still believe that it will cause
more trouble than is worth at this point in time. For example, after
applying your patch, we'd have functionality defines no longer matching
the SMBus helper names (I2C_FUNC_SMBUS_READ_BYTE,
I2C_FUNC_SMBUS_WRITE_BYTE). And you can't easily rename these because
they are part of the i2c-dev API.

I'm not saying that the suggested cleanup shouldn't be done, nor that
it cannot be done. All I'm saying is that it will be a lot of work if
we do it properly, and potentially a lot of trouble for many developers
out there, all for a marginal benefit, and I think that our time can be
better used to solve other, more important problems. And you've done a
very good job at documenting the current implementation, so I hope that
it is clear enough for everyone now.

Thanks,
