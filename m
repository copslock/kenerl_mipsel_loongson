Hi Steven!
I saw your RTAI related posts to the linux-mips mailing list and was wondering 
if you could maybe help me with this: I would like to use rtai with a 2.4.18 
kernel on a MIPS32 box. From the available documentation it's difficult to 
see what version of rtai should/could work with my configuration.
Thanks a lot in advance for any suggestions you might be able to give me!

Take care,

Patrick
