The "Goals" section on the www.linux.sgi.com web page states that the
project would like to achieve  "Ports to newer hardware like O2(TM),
OCTANE(TM), and Origin(TM), and even to old hardware like R3000
Indigo(TM)."

But wasn’t this written two years ago?  How relevant is a port to the
R3000 Indigo?  If it is relevant and people are still interested, how
could one acquire more detailed hardware specifications necessary for a
port?

Thanks
