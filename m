My Indy is not behaving.

The power supply seems to be damaged: if I turn it on shortly after
this the machine will turn itself off.  I need to unplug the machine
for a couple of minutes before trying again to turn it again.

It can not even boot completely, it shuts down before. 

Is it possible to change the power supply with the power supply from a
PC?  The power supply box does not seem to be openable (or I have not
found the screws for it).

Miguel.
