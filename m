This is great news.

I have an indigo2 that I'd really like to use. The serial port solution
isn't really a good one. I really want to use my nice big monitor and all
that cool SGI video hardware. Using SGIlinux on a dumb terminal on a serial
port just doesn't justify the hassle for some reason. IMHO of course..

While I don't code, if you need another machine to test on please let me
know.

Please keep us all informed as to how this progresses.

Off topic: Did everyone see the announcement on slashdot today about NetBSD?

Thanks,

Eric
