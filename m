I assume you only refer to the system documentation.  The CPU documentation
is available for free from {sgigate,www}.sgi.com and a couple of
Mips silicon manufacturers like {ftp,www}.idt.com and others more.

I asked some people at SGI and they'll try to dig out what still
exists.  Somebody came up with a quite nice link for owners of
historic SGI machines.  Check out the site, there is a link to it
on www.linux.sgi.com.
