just curious if anybody has any experiences they would care to share
regarding installing linux on an Origin 2000 system... currently I have 12
total processors.... (1 node w/ 8.... 1 node w/ 4)

and I'm trying to secure a test node (or 2...) for devel purposes....
(ie.. available to group for testing w/ serial console access via another
linux box...)

any suggestions/pointers would be appreciated...

Thanks... Edison
