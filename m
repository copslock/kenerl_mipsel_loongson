Ok. The part I'm not sure about is how to best represent the nvram
in a way that matches the actual hardware.

If the two physical address ranges are just used for the purpose
of showing nvram, that would be fairly straightforward, and we
can jut put both of them in DT, mark them as 'status="disabled"'
by default and let the board specific file enable the one it needs.

However, if these registers really belong into the address range
that is owned by the flash controller device and that is behind
the bcma bus logic, things get a little tricky and we have to decide
whether we want to intentionally put a simplified (and incorrect)
description into the DT to make it easier to use, or to make
the description more correct at the expense of complicating the
code to detect it (thereby negating the intention of this hardware,
which is built to make it easier to boot).

We could still do something like this with a boot wrapper that fills
the fields in the dtb from nvram data. We are pretty flexible in
the kernel when it comes to how that dtb is created, and there is no
requirement to have each board's dts file be part of the kernel sources
if there is some pre-kernel environment (firmware, boot loader,
wrapper, ...) that can generate it for us.

Ok.

Yes, and none of that should interfere with the cleanup plans for MIPS
that RafaÅ‚ talked about, right?

Ah, good. So to confirm: all the essential devices including irqchip,
clocksource, uart and nvram can be accessed without using the bcma bus,
right?
Does that mean they are actually connected to another bus, or are they
actually bcma bus devices for which you provide an additional probe
method using dt/platform_device?

Right. Importantly for the console, there are patches to allow a very
early output by having some minimal dt parsing done before start
accessing any other hardware. I think this is valuable even if it
means we compromise on the accurate DT description. We do the same
thing for consoles on other buses (ISAPnP, PCI, of_platform, ...)
and a lot of serial drivers have a way to retroactively connect that
early console setup to the actual device once it is probed normally.
