I don't remember who said it, but someone commented on v2 that they
had a patch for this.

I'd like to hear what Ralf thinks about it, it's really his decision.
What I was pointing out here are things that are still in the way of
a real "multiplatform" implementation. None of these are really hard
to do, but I don't know where you are heading with MIPS.

I think in case of the last one, it's really just a matter of moving the
file, you could delete the other copies later.

Possibly, but that seems unrelated. Moving this file is required
in order to use IRQCHIP_DECLARE, which is defined in
drivers/irqchip/irqchip.h.

I guess prom_init() doesn't do what I expected it to on MIPS then.
On powerpc, this is where we call into Open Firmware. No point changing
it now I guess.

For a real multiplatform kernel, the function would likely have to
be matched up with a root DT compatible property like your fixups.

If the goal is being able to have a multiplatform kernel
that can cover more than just BMIPS, I think this would have
to be documented as the only way for MIPS multiplatform.

If that isn't possible, most of my other comments here are
moot, but then you shouldn't call it "multiplatform" but just
"generic BMIPS" or something like that.

I would do it for all "multiplatform" implementations, i.e. BMIPS
for now and then any other platform that is ready to convert to that.

The existing platforms already provide their own device_tree_init()
function already.

Ok, got it. So in a multiplatform kernel, this would be another function
pointer I guess, but it would always return this string for any BMIPS
system.

To clarify where I was getting to here: In a generic multiplatform kernel,
you would probably want to always look at the dma-ranges properties here,
at least if there are one or more platforms built into the kernel that
don't just have a flat mapping that the current mach-generic header
provides.

I mean every system that today uses the plain mach-generic/spaces.h.
