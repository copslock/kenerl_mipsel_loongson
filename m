Hi,
	I have come into possesion of the SGI Indy Workstation with a R5000 processor.

I have been going thorugh a number of site that I could find and have found a number of out of date distribution, and have manage to get the simple distribution partially working.

If someone could point me to a resonable distribution I would be grateful....

Jason
