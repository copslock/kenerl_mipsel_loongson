But it is!

It is just laid out differently.

Industry standard SDRAM chips but to get the wider memory path
they layed them out differently.

They used a different JDEC standard DIMM (the same as in some notebooks)
because the motherboard would have been a mess using the giant, more
commond desktop-PC JDEC standard modules.

The idea is a high-bandwith arch. at PC prices and to do that you have
to make some tough decisions.  Otherwise the OCTANE is a far better (and $)
arch. that is just dying for faster processors and next-gen graphics.

Who cares.  It is all in the application performance.  We will soon see...
