Alex - can you check all the ones you are missing against the files
on ftp.uk.linux.org dated Dec 22nd or later. Those dated earlier than
Jan 7th want rebuilding as they were built with buggy binutils but
I've got several of your missing packages and fixes (like elm,mailx)
on there

I've also uploaded international PGP and ssh onto ftp.uk.linux.org
ssh seems to work , sshd wont authenticate. I've not had time to find
out why yet


Alan
