Hi,
  With help from some of the guys on the #mipslinux IRC channel I've
managed to force a Linux kernel onto my Indy's internal disc.

One problem is that I'd like to pass some parameters to it, but it is not
obvious to me which prom environment variable to put them in - any
suggestions???

Thanks in advance,

Dave
