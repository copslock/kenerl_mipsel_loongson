If the space of possible instructions that need to run in the user's
MM context is sufficiently small, perhaps we could emulate the rest in
kernelspace and have a fixed code mapping exposed to userspace
containing each possible MM-context-dependent instruction combination.

As an alternative, the kernel could expose emulator code to run in
userspace as part of the vdso or other magic kernel-provided pages,
and this code would be capable of emulating arbitrary instructions,
which would of course take place in the user MM context.

This does not solve the problem for hardware with custom instructions,
but I still believe it's totally reasonable to say that the ABI does
not allow putting custom instructions in delay slots for coprocessor
branches.

Signal trampolines were nonsense to begin with. The code needed is
fixed, not variable per-signal-instance, so it can be provided by libc
or by the kernel in the vdso page or similar.

"First time it actually needs to emulate" does not work, since it may
be impossible to allocate at that time, and then there's no way the
program can proceed. The allocation must be done at a time when you
can report failure, which means at the time of execve (for the main
thread) and clone (for other threads).
