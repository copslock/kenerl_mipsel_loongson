Well, Linux support for these boxes has suffered from bitrot over the
past few years.  Same for the basically identical MIPS Magnum 4000 and
MIPS Millenium and the fairly similar PICA family.  I don't have my
Acer PICA anymore, so the recent work I did in cleaning up the 2.6
support probably won't boot but anyway, it should be rather close to
working, so not too hard to debug.
