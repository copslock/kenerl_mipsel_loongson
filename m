i know, i know.. I've read parts of the archive, and have lurked on
the list for a few months. However, it seems to me the Indy (little
endian linux/mips, right?) does at least boot and run some userspace
stuff.

i'm here more for the fun factor. (i've run linux on x86, Alpha
and PPC. Love to see it just booting on MIPS :) )

incidentally, i tried booting the 2.2.13 kernel from the website. It
appeared to work as the PROM downloaded it and didn't complain, but
it produced absolutely no output. and when i pressed a key it booted
back to PROM.

do these kernels require serial console?
