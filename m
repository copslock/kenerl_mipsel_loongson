Something like ~50 searches using multiple keywords, and found nothing but a few
vague mentions of people getting Netbsd to boot, or stating that Linux runs on
the 130.  No touchpad drivers/info, or any technical info on the Pencentra
hardware, which is what I really wanted.  

It's all well and good that the kernel boots using a bootloader from CE, but
it's much more useful if there are drivers for hardware other than the serial
port.  Hence the question here, in the heart of Linux/mips development, which
will tell me if I'm about to re-invent the wheel trying to get this thing up and
running.
