For what it's worth, I've *tried* to put together a small but
up-to-date page at www.paralogos.com/mipslinux/ that
links to most of the old and some of the new pages,
and which has downloads for the unofficial MIPS
Technologies kernel, and mipsel/mipseb userlands.
But that server is going to fill up pretty soon - there's
only 1G total available, and it also hosts some other
functions.

I think it would be great to have a mnemonic domain
name like linux-mips.org, but how much disk space is
behind it?   Sombody at MIPS in Mountain View was to
establish a project at SourceForge for "MIPS Linux",
which would have a certain amount of disk space
behind it.  I need to get the "keys" to that and see what
can be done with it.
