Nick--

First of all, thanks for responding!

Do you know any way to make the Origin 200 operate more quietly?  I'm a
hardware geek, so I know that there are cooling issues and air-flow issues,
but the darned thing is so loud that I can't just keep it running all the
time.  If I keep it on, it's distracting, even when I put it in another room
with the door closed.  (My hearing is pretty sensitive...)

It's in an air-conditioned house, and I don't mind putting in some
temperature sensors to shut it off when it gets too warm inside...  I'd hate
to go to the trouble of creating a noise-muffling cabinet if there's some
known way of making the beast a bit quieter.  (Since I don't beat the disk
drives up, they shouldn't generate much heat.  I wouldn't mind pulling out
all the drives but one, if that would help...)

Since I have a couple of 'em (as well as another couple of loud rack-mount
boxes), I've even considered building a custom cabinet with a single
large-capacity fan in it to draw air through all four boxes, and mount a
dozen LM34-based temperature sensors at strategic points in the boxes to shut
'em all down if it gets too warm in the cabinet...
