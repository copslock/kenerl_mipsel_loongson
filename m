No - we don't... We used to, but your patch stops that from happening if
the FIFO enable bit is clear.... And the FIFO enable bit is clear during
serial8250_do_startup() if the UART was used with earlycon, otherwise it
depends on state left behind by the bootloader. I don't know how many
ways I can say this.

It did not, you are wrong. serial_out() calls ingenic_uart_serial_out()
which unconditionally or's in the UME bit for writes to FCR.

This is where the brokenness seems to come from. As I said, this would
be fine according to the PC16550D documentation but I can say based on
experimentation that it is *not* fine on the JZ4780.

Resetting a disabled FIFO makes perfect sense if it's going to be
enabled later. That used to happen, and after your patch it doesn't.

Yes.

What you asked before though was whether we need to disable the FIFO in
order to clear it, which is a different question.

I can only tell you what little the JZ4780 manual says & what actually
works when I run it on my system. I used the word supect to explain my
theory, but that's the best we can do with the documentation available.

...which is why I effectively renamed it
serial8250_clear_and_disable_fifos() in my suggested patch. Did you test
it? I have no OMAP3 system to check that I didn't break your setup, and
at this point if I can't be sure it works I'll be submitting a revert of
your broken patch.

Correct, but not when the FIFO is disabled in serial8250_do_startup(),
nor when the FIFO is later enabled in serial8250_do_set_termios().

Again, wrong. Look at what serial_out() actually does & see
ingenic_uart_serial_out(). Again, the Ingenic UARTs have worked fine
until your patch, and work with mainline after reverting it - the
problem is *entirely* with the change you made & the UME bit has nothing
to do with it.

Thanks,
