Sorry, Andrea, I can't answer your question, but I've got one for you..

I have an old Indy too (R4K) and I would like to test the debian you
told about.. I couldn't find it (the mips port) on the debian site.

Do someone know where I could find the bin distro, ready to boot to
from the Indy ??

For now, I could just boot the kernel of the old Hard Hat (nfs root
doesn't work for me) from the local SCSI disk containing an Irix.

Thanks,

Nicolas Sauzede.
