Thanks for testing!

That sounds like a good idea.

One concern is to define a non-inline function in *.h.  But,
iommu-helper.h is included only by these two drivers, so there is no
problem as now, although a comment would be more helpful.

Yes.  My patches are still based on older version (2.6.27-rc2 or so).

git cares renaming well, so it shouldn't be a big problem.
I just tested it now and git-pull (oh now it's "git pull" :) renames
it automatically indeed.


thanks,
