This guarantee is not made known to the DMA API or the per-arch code backing 
it, nor can I see it documented anywhere. It's good to hear that it exists in 
some form though.

My previous message simply walked through your existing example & explained 
why your assumptions can be incorrect as far as the DMA API & interactions 
with caches go - I don't think that warrants the seemingly confrontational 
tone.

How about this:

  https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/9423097/

Now this isn't networking code at fault, it was a problem with MMC. Given that 
you say there's a guarantee that networking code won't write to cache lines 
that partially include memory mapped for DMA, perhaps networking code is 
immune to this issue (though at a minimum I think that guarantee ought to be 
documented so that others know to keep it true).

The question remains though: what would you have us do to catch the broken 
uses of the DMA API with non-cacheline-aligned memory? By not obeying 
Documentation/DMA-API.txt you're preventing us from adding checks that catch 
others who also disobey the alignment requirement in ways that are not fine, 
and which result in otherwise difficult to track down memory corruption.

One disconnect here is that you describe a "new restriction" whilst the 
restriction we're talking about has been documented in Documentation/DMA-
API.txt since at least the beginning of the git era - it is not new at all.

The only thing that changed for us that I have intended to warn when the 
restriction is not met, because that often indicates genuine & otherwise 
difficult to detect bugs such as the MMC one I linked to above. FYI that 
warning has not gone into mainline yet anyway.

I'd suggest that at a minimum if you're unwilling to obey the API as described 
in Documentation/DMA-API.txt then it would be beneficial if you could propose 
a change to it such that it works for you, and perhaps we can extend the API & 
its documentation to allow your usage whilst also allowing us to catch broken 
uses.

Surely we can agree that the current situation wherein networking code clearly 
disobeys the documented API is not a good one, and that allowing other broken 
uses to slip by unnoticed except in rare difficult to track down corner cases 
is not good either.

Thanks,
    Paul
