 Well, here is most of the information available from the site...

                 Welcome to http://strace.sourceforge.net/

      We're Sorry but this Project hasn't yet uploaded their personal
                                webpage yet.
          Please check back soon for updates or visit SourceForge

 Where is the CVS you refer to?  A working strace would help me a lot.
