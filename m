You could wait until we have finished boot-floppies for this machine
(1-3 weeks) or bootstrap from scratch by using a kernel and a Debian
base system.  Both is available, Karsten can also provide a correct
2.4.x kernel.

I'd rather like to ask you to wait a couple of days/weeks until
boot-floppies are available for this machine and you can use the
regular Debian installation process which will be less painful
than the other.  If you do so, please come back to us in some
days/weeks to find out if things are ready already.

Regards,

	Joey
