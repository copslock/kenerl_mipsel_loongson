The problem the original patch fixed was that too many bits were cleared
in the FCR on OMAP3/AM335x . If you have such a system (a beaglebone or
similar), you can come up with a solution which can accommodate both the
JZ4780 and AM335x. Can you take a look ? The datasheet for both should
be public too.
