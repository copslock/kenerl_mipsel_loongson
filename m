Dear All, 

    I built my kernel for Yamon and U-Boot boot loader, 
    while I booted my kernel 2.6.15 with Yamon, 
    I got the system messages for kernel booting, 
    but I lost the system messages for U-Boot kernel 2.6.15 booting. 
    Are there some option for debug messages? 

    By the way, I got the system messages for Yamon, 
    with kernel 2.6.15 booting, 
    but I lost the system messages for Yamon with kernel 2.6.16.16 booting.
    Would someone please tell me the answer? 

    Thanks a lot. 

    Charles C.K. Lai
