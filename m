At least in Kconfig, the two are not mutually exclusive, so I assumed
you could enable them both at the same time.

Absolutely agreed.

Yes, that's why I suggested following PowerPC rather than ARM in this
regard.  If you move the boot loader abstraction into the decompressor
instead of the platform code, you can avoid a lot of the problems.
