Sorry, been tied up lately.  I haven't done a deep-dive of the way the PCI
code actually assigns/claims addresses, but this sounds mostly correct to
me.  Reading in the document I cited, these addresses are actually "virtual
addresses", but I am uncertain if they're "virtual" in the same sense that
the Linux kernel regards as virtual (as in allocated by the kernel's memory
manager).

It's a hardware-specific mechanism.  The IP27 platform was a
massively-scalable (for its time) system that supported up to 128 CPUs
spread across 64 nodeboards in 8 racks (4 nodeboards per system module).  So
SGI designed the address space big enough such that all nodes and all
devices assigned to each node could be addressed by using offsets from the
address space of Node 0.

The basic bit assignment for an address runs like this:

63:62 - address space selection
61:59 - cache algorithm
58:57 - uncached attribute
56:44 - not translated by TLB
39:00 - index to physical space when 63:62 == 10b (physical addressing)

IP27 uses this bit assignment to layout five address spaces:
  - Cached (63:62 are any value other than 10b)
  - HUB Special (58:57 == 00b)
  - I/O Special (58:57 == 01b)
  - Memory Special (58:57 == 10b)
  - Uncached (58:57 == 11b)

So if 63:62 are 10b (physical address), 61:59 are 010b (uncached), and 58:57
are 01b (I/O space), that results in the address 0x92xxxxxxxxxxxxxx, which
tells the hardware you're trying to access uncached I/O space, and thus, an
I/O device.  The remaining bits in the address are used to specify the
particular node the device is attached to all the way down to the
device-specific address value itself.  There's also things like "little
windows" and "big windows" that I don't fully understand just yet, as
they're a function of the Crosstalk (XIO) bus that the PCI busses are
actually attached to within the system.

Yup, I can see that on my SGI Octane machine (IP30 platform), which is
architecturally-similar to IP27, but uses a more "normal" addressing layout.
 Previously, it was also setting the PCI_PROBE_ONLY flag and thus
/proc/iomem looked very similar to IP27's output.  Now, however, Octane's
/proc/iomem looks more like this:

# cat /proc/iomem
00000000-00003fff : reserved
1d200000-1d9fffff : Bridge MEM
  d080000000-d080003fff : 0001:00:03.0
  1d204000-1d204fff : 0001:00:02.0
  1d205000-1d205fff : 0001:00:02.1
  1d206000-1d206fff : 0001:00:02.2
  1d207000-1d2070ff : 0001:00:02.3
  1d207100-1d20717f : 0001:00:01.0
1f200000-1f9fffff : Bridge MEM
  f080100000-f0801fffff : 0000:00:02.0
  f080010000-f08001ffff : 0000:00:00.0
  f080030000-f08003ffff : 0000:00:01.0
  f080000000-f080000fff : 0000:00:00.0
  f080020000-f080020fff : 0000:00:01.0
20004000-20a27fff : reserved
  20004000-207180b7 : Kernel code
  207180b8-2090ffff : Kernel data
20a28000-20efffff : System RAM
20f00000-20ffffff : System RAM
21000000-9fffffff : System RAM
f080100000-f0801fffff : ioc3

And /proc/ioports:
# cat /proc/ioports
1da00000-1dbfffff : Bridge IO
  1da00000-1da000ff : 0001:00:01.0
  1da00400-1da0047f : 0001:00:01.0
1fa00000-1fbfffff : Bridge IO
  f100000000-f1000000ff : 0000:00:00.0
  f100000100-f1000001ff : 0000:00:01.0

PCI support on IP27 has been a bit weird for a long time, mostly due to it
using a lot of "IRIX'isms" in the code to get it working initially.  Some of
these are actually short-circuits for things that would instead use normal
kernel mechanisms, and no one's really had the time or interest to try and
clean it up.  I've done a significant amount of refactoring of the IP27's
machine-specific code so far the last few months, but haven't spent much
time understanding PCI and XIO some more to make further progress.  Lack of
time has made it difficult to break those code changes down into bite-sized
patches to send back upstream (I should've planned things a bit better...).
