I have no real orientation about workstation second hand prices.  An Indy
R5000SC 180MHz, 64mb, 17" Monitor and unknown gfx option is being advertised
for around DEM 5000 (DEM 1.65 == USD 1) including tax by second hand
workstation dealers here in Germany.  You should be able to get a second
hand Indy much cheaper than that since most people will orient their
prices on PCs which have ridiculuous second hand prices.
