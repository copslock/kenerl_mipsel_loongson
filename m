Hi, All:

I have built the linux kernel, glibc, gcc , and init for my mips r3000
cpu. The file /etc/ld-2.0.6.so is needed when I boot the system but I do
not know how to build it. 

If you know, please let me know

1. Where could I get the source code?
2. Which files should I use?
3. How could I build it?

Thanks,

Steven Liu
