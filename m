Hi,

I am new to Linux. But I have a strong ARM & MIPS background with kernel 
porting & other stuff.

I want to get a higher-level view of the essential components of Linux for 
MIPS & documentation about the kernel. Please point me to documents on the 
net.

Question 2:
Does Linux-MIPS support the MIPS Atlas board with 4Kc processor using 
mipsisa32-elf build tool chain (Contain the appropriate HAL or BSP)? Is so, 
please point me to documents that gives the exact build steps for the same.

Also do let me know if Cygwin over Win98 dev. environment is good for 
building & developing with Linux-MIPS or do I need to have Linux installed 
on my dev. machine?

Thanks a lot,
-Mike.
