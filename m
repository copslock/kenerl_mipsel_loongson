After reviewing a bit this driver and the JZ480 one on the CI20 repo,
there seems to be some differences.

To begin with, the JZ480 apparently has a new 8-word descriptor.

The HDMI looks pretty much a Synopsys DW HDMI, mostly compatible
with the dw-hdmi encoder.

I'll try to put together some patches to enable JZ4780 support.
Won't happen anytime soon, so if anyone wants to give it
a shot, be my guest :-)

Eze
