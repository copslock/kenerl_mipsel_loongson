Patches as attachments are actually really convenient with Mutt.
You can view them seperately, extract and save them easily, etc.

To comment on both the original message and the attachments: use
view-attachments (v), use tag-entry (t) on all of the parts you want
quoted in your reply, and then use tag-prefix & reply (;r) 
(or ;g or whatever).

But I digress :)
