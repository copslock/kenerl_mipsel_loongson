Is this link good enough to add it to the driver? From a quick view I'd
say this is another pwm implementation that gets active on pwm_disable().
Can you confirm this?

depending on the possible timings you might also be able to test this
e.g. by setting:

	duty_cycle=1ms, period=5s

and then

	duty_cycle=5s, period=5s

. If the implementation is right your display should be dark for nearly
5 seconds. (And the second call to pwm_apply should also block until the
display is on.)

Can you confirm the things you think above? I'd like to have them
eventually documented in the driver.

I understand your reasoning, but I think it's misleading. If I get
-EBUSY from a PWM driver I'd start searching for another user of said
resource. With ENXIO or ENODEV it's more obvious that the driver isn't
responsible for the resource that was requested.
