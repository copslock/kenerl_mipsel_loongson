FWIW, Ralf also has a patch, that I have tested, that takes a slightly 
different approach.

In any event, it would be nice if one of the patches were merged to 
2.6.30 before it is released.  GCC-4.4 has been available for quite a 
while now.  Not being able to build the kernel with it will become a 
larger issue as time goes by.
