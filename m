I've wondered about this, and yeah, I would like to see the number drop
to 0 if at all possible (the scsi driver will not change), so i'll be
glad to take patches for the code that is no longer in upstream.

Ugh, I thought I had found this one in the past, sorry about that, now
applied.

I'll take a fix :)

I'll take it! :)

Yeah, this one is going to have to stay as-is :(

That commit is from 3.4, so how can I add it to 3.18? :)

Ugh, I don't know why this one wasn't in 3.18, that makes me wonder what
I missed that went into 4.4 that didn't make it to 3.18...

That was in 3.18.14, what kernel are you looking at here???

That commit id isn't in Linus's tree, where did you get it from?

That was in 3.17, are you sure you are looking at 3.18 like the subject
says???

I'll do the rest after lunch...
