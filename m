Manuel,

Thanks for sending these out again.  I've patched my tree (an up-to-date
git of 2.6.27-rc1) and have some preliminary feedback:
1.  I like the interface you added in patch #10.  Much better than the
old /proc one and flexible enough for a lot of different boards.  I
agree with your own comment that maybe it should be in the
board-specific directories so that people can name the nodes better, but
for now I think this is great.

2.  If I use the db1200_defconfig and enable Power Management
(CONFIG_PM), the build fails on the Au1xxx IDE and fb drivers.  Are you
seeing this too?  I see no reason to reject this patch if they don't
build with CONFIG_PM, I just want to make sure I'm not doing something
wrong.

3.  In my preliminary testing, the system was able to suspend and resume
correctly on a DB1200 board.  I will do some stress testing in the next
couple of days to make sure that it is stable in the long term. 

Thanks again.
-Kevin
