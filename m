Oh no, I am using Atlas board with 2.4 kernel and I know few others also
using it (guess they dont care anymore :( .  If its not a time killer
could you please add it to 2.5 also.

BTW I was running network performance tools and the max I could read from
Atlas board is ~0.3M. Is this a problem with the hardware?

Thanks a lot,
Muthu.
