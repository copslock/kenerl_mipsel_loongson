I have some ultra simple hardware questions that I couldn't find answers
to.  Excuse the noviceness of it all, I haven't touched SGI hardware in
quite some time.

1. Do Indy's come equipped with floppy drives?  What are they?  Is it
possible to boot from them?

2. I know O2's have PCI busses with a custom controller.  Do Indy's have
this too? What is the name of this controller? It would seem reasonably
easy to slap a PCI VGA card in there and port XFree86 to run on it.

3. Do Indy's ship with CDROMs?

As an aside, I asked Erik Troan for the source for the RedHat Install
program, and he seems quite interested in SGI-Linux.
