Excellent!
I'm going to try and con another loaner out of the guys up here (hi,
Kev! =) ) when they actually reclaim mine.

Currently, I'm trying to get my laptop to talk to the network under
Linux (can't see the docking station's ethernet) so I can get the
xcompiler on here.  Right now, I'm working off of a DX4/100, and it's
kinda slow going.  I've been putting off a full rebuild of glibc for
the Indy until I get a faster setup.  (I was tempted to set up the
Irix-hosted stuff, but I don't have the machine for long enough to
warrant the effort.)

Tomorrow, I'm going to try to build the nettools and apache with the
xcompiler.  I fear I'm at the edge of my abilities with the current
kernel stuff, although I may try and track down some of the undefined
symbols if I get some time.

(David?  Inglo?)

Mike
