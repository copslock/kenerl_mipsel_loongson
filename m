Does anyone have (recent) links or info on getting standard VGA cards to 
work with Linux/MIPS?

I'm working with an Alchemy DBAu1550 eval board and I'd like to get VGA 
going on it somehow. The only 3.3V PCI card I have been able to find is 
an old NVidia Riva. As I understand it, some VGA cards rely on the PC 
BIOS to be initialized, but there was some work being done to emulate 
that. All of the links I've found so far on this list and other places 
no longer work.

Thanks
