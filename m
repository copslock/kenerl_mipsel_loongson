I gave it some _really_ good pushes, didn't work at all. Yes, my Indy is
old (and certainly very crappy). I have never got that error with the
R4000SC (I've also switched processors back after testing the R4600PC, and
the R4000SC still works). Do you think this fault can be caused by damage
from static electricity?

I'm really disappointed with myself, life, and everything if I vaporized
this processor and this great chance to run Linux.
