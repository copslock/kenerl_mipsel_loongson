No I can't, not in the current implementation at least.

In this function, I set the irq chip handler which needs one of the
below irq_chip. As you can see, the set_type function is also defined in
those two structures.

Let me give you a real world use case, the reason why I used EOI.

I've a PHY interrupt line that connects to a GPIO of this controller.
The PHY holds the line until the PHY acknowledges the reason for
generating an interrupt. So we can say that it's a LEVEL_HIGH
"interrupt".

The GPIO interrupt controller generates an interruption whenever the
GPIO line has changed (0->1 or 1->0).

In a "normal" use case, I'd have the PHY holding high the line, the GPIO
controller generating an interrupt because the line has changed. We
acknowledge the interrupt in the GPIO controller. Later, we acknowledge
in the PHY the reason why we had to generate an "interrupt" on the PHY
side, resulting in the line being now held low. This generates another
interrupt on the GPIO controller side. However, only one actual
interrupt should have been generated by the GPIO controller as there's
only one event that resulted in an "interrupt" generation from the PHY.

So, we need EOI so that the GPIO controller interrupt gets acked only
when the PHY event is acked so that we don't receive an unexpected
interrupt.

However, we also need the common irq handler behaviour as we might want
to have the interrupt generated for 0->1 AND 1->0 transition depending
on the IP connected to the GPIO.

I could make my use case work with EOI but I find it very specific to my
use case and thus added the support for a more commonly found (IMHO) use
case.

I'd say that, yes, the two irqchips are needed but I may be missing
another way to handle all that.

Thanks,
Quentin
