Hi,

We got our hands on a Challenge S the other day.  We're planning to
install Linux on it and let it do something useful, but we don't have
any use for the SCSI adapter.  If anyone out there are working on
Linux drivers for these cards, we'd be happy to let them have it.  If
anyone is interested, send me a mail.

Regards,
