That Dave Miller is back at massaging Linux to work on the Indy is
great news from Ariel -- Thanks, Ariel.

One of the departments in one of India's premier Technical Institutes,
the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), New Delhi has decided to
purchase hardware if and only if the vendor can demonstrate Linux
running on it. I hope to meet the professor concerned (*) with this
decision in the coming week (or the week after). Any ammo you can arm
me with to face him and make him consider SGI would be very welcome.

Thanks and regards,

-- Raju

(*) And good to see that there are a few right-minded people
everywhere :-)
