	This month's issue of the the IEEE Computer Magazine, February
	1999, Pages 125-128, has a very well written editorial about the
	"Linux" and Open Source "movement". The article/editorial is titled
	"The Open Source Acid Test" and was written by Ted Lewis.

	If I can find an on-line version, I'll e-mail it to the mailing list.
	For those that take this publication it is a pretty good read.

	Ted Lewis's bottom line is that the Linux and Open Source movement
	has been gaining market share starting with nothing both because is
	is "free" and because it is simple and relatively easy to extend
	since the Linux kernel is still a small number of lines of code.

	His main argument is that the first wave of market acceptance is
	"easy" since you are starting from zero. When "Linux or Open Source"
	becomes a competitive threat to the major computer vendors and software
	vendors, Microsoft and the others will use the "absorb-and-extend"
	used against Netscape, to neutralize your market penetration and
	reduce your competitive threat.

	Also these is a nice discussion on the total-cost-of-ownership of
	software products, and a number of graphs of the complexity versus
	time of OS's and applications.

	The Linux and *BSD Communities I believe are just beginning to see
	the the limits of "free" volunteer labor. Jordon Hubbard state of the
	Union message to the FreeBSD mailing list notes a couple of disturbing
	trends.

	How the future of the Open Source movement and any business'es which
	are based on this model will play out in the silicon valley will be
	interesting to watch.


	A number of the steps which have occurred in the Open Source
	movement are predicted by a number of Ted's observations. I wonder
	how far it will go until Microsoft does something to co-op it.
