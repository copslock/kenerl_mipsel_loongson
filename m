Hi all. :)  

AFAIK, none of the SGI graphics cards for the indigo2 are yet
supported by linux or X.  However, it recently struck me, these
machines have EISA slots.  It might be pretty straightforward to use
an old EISA card like an ATI Mach32 instead.  Sure, it's not as cool
as an Impact card, but it's perfectly adequate for emacs.

Is this a good idea? How would you estimate the effort involved?

Thanks for any feedback,
Tim
