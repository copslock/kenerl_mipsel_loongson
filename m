Right, that's what I meant. We can't assume anything. Our(kernel) job
is just to:
 1. Increment / decrement counter in sync. No matter what is the value
    of counter before operation.
 2. Make sure that counter does not go negative by the kernel.
 3. Make sure that kernel is not harmed in any case.

This is really a cool idea. Let me explore that.
