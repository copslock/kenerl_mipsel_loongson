    Yes. And your mailer has probably added another space to lines already 
begginign with space. Some mailers tend to do it, don't know sure why... :-/

    I hadn't but I had no doubts it'll fail... just tried, not a single hunk

    Agreed then (though still seems avoidable).

    Hm, isn't it CPU write buffer flush? Shouldn't this be handled more 
generically?

    It comes into action only if you specify console=uart,... kernel option 
for the eraly console support.  The "plain" 8250 console driver is containded 
within 8250.c itself.

    Well, this part of the patch can't be considered complete then (how LSR 
polling is going to work?), so should either be removed or the proper regshift 
support added.

    Well, Xscale introduced several bits. And note that 16650 definitions are 
kept with the "standard" 16550 ones.  Well, be sure to elaborate the comment 
whereever you stick that #define.
