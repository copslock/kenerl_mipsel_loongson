Let me just quote you:

"This is mostly habitual -- this is what the GNU Coding Standard specifies
for comments and which is enforced for GNU software which I have dealt a
lot with."

You didn't say it was common sense. You did say that it was what the
GNU Coding Standard specified, and as a consequence, what you were used
to. So please keep your "oh come on" for yourself, you pointed the
discussion in this direction yourself.

What matters is not "the pieces of code I am interested in", but the
pieces of code _you_ are the master of, or not. As explained somewhere
else in this thread, you are free to use whatever style you like (as
long as it complies with Documentation/CodingStyle, that is) in new
code you write and in code you maintain. For all the rest, you should
stick to the surrounding style. This is common sense, as you'd say.

i2c_add_numbered_adapter() _may_ fail if no I2C devices have been
declared _and_ other i2c adapters are registered using
i2c_add_adapter(). When you declare I2C devices, i2c-core reserves the
bus numbers in question for i2c_add_numbered_adapter() and they cannot
be used for i2c_add_adapter(). This is what guarantees that the calls
to i2c_add_numbered_adapter() (in i2c-sibyte for example) will succeed.
If no I2C devices are declared, bus numbers are not reserved, so if it
happens that another I2C bus driver registers itself before i2c-sibyte
does, when i2c-sibyte calls i2c_add_numbered_adapter(), the bus number
is already in use and the call fails.

I admit that this is unlikely to happen, but depending on what exact
hardware there is on the system and what drivers are built-in, it could
happen. I think it is a weakness of i2c-core, it should allow platform
code to reserve i2c bus numbers regardless of what devices are
registered. I seem to remember I said that when the code was added to
the kernel already. I guess we'll have to fix it the day it actually
breaks.

BTW, i2c-sibyte should be converted to a proper platform driver, so
that only platforms with such a device instantiate it.

Which legacy driver, "eeprom"? You should probably look into David
Brownell's at24c driver:
http://lists.lm-sensors.org/pipermail/i2c/2008-April/003307.html
If it gets enough attention and testing, it could go upstream quickly.
