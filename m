Isn't this the point where anarchy ensues? Think of it this way: How many
linux boxes are out there. Basically for every linux box out there we have
a backup of the code. If the M$ people got legal rights to Linux they
couldn't possibly enforce a NDA agreement on the most current version of
Linux. So then there would be MS Linux product line, and we would still
keep developing Linux, at worst witha different name. Not that this
wouldn't piss us off, but we would overcome and continue... right!

So, the point is that Linux has this subtlety about it that it can't ever
really die. It's sort of taken on it's own life.
