Another contact is: andy@waldorf-gmbh.de

He was the one driving the porting group when I was last talking with them...when 
asked about SGI boxes he always complained that the reason they didn't work on them
was that they couldn't get the info they needed!  I'm sure they would be interested
in what is happening here.  As far as I know they have an ARCS machine up and
running, and have all the crossdev stuff done (but I guess we don't need that).

Cheers, Alistair
