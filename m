As you probably know, you can determine the size of a BAR regardless of
whether it has been assigned.  So it doesn't matter whether ARCS has
already assigned anything.  See __pci_read_base().

The simplest possible thing is to enable some pre-defined set of
windows and accept that this may lead to configuration restrictions,
e.g., a device with large BARs may work only in certain slots.

No, when matching a BAR value to a host bridge window, the PCI core
will definitely not look for the smallest (or largest) window that
contains the BAR.  

The core reads the BAR value (a bus address), then searches the host
bridge windows for one that maps to a region that contains the bus
address.  This happens in pcibios_bus_to_resource(), which is called
by __pci_read_base().

The search order is undefined because the core assumes the windows do
not overlap in PCI bus address space.  It can't deal with two windows
that map to the same PCI space because when we allocate space when
assigning a BAR, we search for available CPU address space, not for
available PCI bus address space.

If window A and window B both map to PCI bus address X, we may assign
space from window A to PCI BAR 1 and space from window B to PCI BAR 2.
Then we have two BARs at the same PCI bus address, which will cause
conflicts.

I don't think we currently check in the PCI core for host bridge
windows that map to overlapping PCI bus space.  Maybe we should, and
just reject anything that overlaps.
