Actually you are right. The lack of docs internally in SGI has caused this
problem. This also has had the bad side effect of when they lose a
critical employee then no one else has a clue on how it program it. You
have to start from scratch. 

[OT]. This actually happend to M$ as well. One person wrote they entire
registery for win95. He left the company and when it came time to port it
to win2000 no one understood how it worked. So they had to rewrite it from
scratch.
