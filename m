Thanks.  I've just brought it into my local copies of loongson-community
branches for 4.4, 4.9, 4.14, 4.19, and 4.20, and master, after verifying
that it enables at least 4.19, 4.20 and master to reboot without a power
cycle, and I'll include it in upcoming freeloong builds, except for 3.16
and 3.18, where it doesn't apply.

Hmm, I don't think I've ever hit this one.  Do you happen to know how
far back it might be needed?

Thanks!
