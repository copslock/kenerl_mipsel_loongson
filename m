Yeah, I figured there wasn't one, SGI just wouldn't do that, but if you
goto www.sgi.com/software/irix6.5/ the picture at the
bottom(irix_chart.gif) sort of implies to me that the Onyx2's and Origins
will be running IRIX-IA64, now maybe I am misunderstanding this chart, but
if I am, then other people might, and you know how news articles come out,
I believe that the SGI/HP Cnet article recently at the last paragraph
referred to Linux as a language.
