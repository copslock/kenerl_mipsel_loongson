Greetings.

If you have ever attempted to download and use the ABI documents
from either Caldera or from SGI for the MIPS ABI and or the
System V Interface Definition Fourth Edition documents, you
will find that they are corrupted. I have uploaded the repaired
documents in both PDF and PS format:

    ftp://ftp.cotw.com/ABI

Ralf, would you please replace the files on the SGI FTP site with
these? I have already emailed Caldera to update the documents.
Thanks.

-Steve
