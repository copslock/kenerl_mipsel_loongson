Thank a lot for this information.  Based on this, I will check it
again in the MIPS platform.

Oh.. I am sorry for creating confusion. I have added these lines (
........) just to show that I haven't shared the
complete output in order to reduce the length of the mail.

Thanks a lot for sharing the detailed steps.I will perform the test as
mentioned above and will share the results.
