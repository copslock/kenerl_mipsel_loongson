Easy of implmentation and more features.

Here is the pseudo code to do a real-time periodic task with /dev/ptimer:

void periodic_task(void)
{
	fd=open("/dev/ptimer", O_RDONLY);
	ioctl(fd, PTIMER_SET_PERIOD, PERIOD);
	ioctl(fd, PTIMER_SET_PHASE, PHASE);
	
	/* become realtime process */
	start_realtime();

	for(;;) {
		/* read won't return until next instance release point */
		read(fd, &count, sizeof(count));

		/* do the job */
		...
	}
}

Anybody who has used setitimer() would konw this is even simpler than the
setup of itimer, let alone with itimer you still need to deal with SIGALRM
signals plus some multi-thread signal handling considerations.

On the feature side, ptimer offers the exact control of phase.  For example,
you can have two tasks with period of 100ms, with one starting *exactly* at
time t and the other starting *exactly* at t+50 ms later.

Some unimplemented features allow you to control the behavior when missing
deadlines.
