Yes, as far as I understand the AI bus behaves mostly like a SSB bus
except for places like enabling/disabling cores. E.g. the AI bus also
has a common core, which has a bit for telling whether its a SSB or AI
bus, and has the mostly the same registers as the SSB common cores (so
most driver_chipcommon_* stuff also applies for the AI bus).

That's because most shared code isn't in brcm80211, but only found in
the SDKs for the SoCs.

It probably can, but then the SSB code must be at least made AI aware
so it doesn't try to attach itself if it finds one. Also I don't know
if it is a good idea to let arch-specific code depend on code in
staging.
