The mailing list linux@engr.sgi.com is moving to linux-mips@oss.sgi.com.
I've copied the old subscription list, so there is no need to
resubscribe.  Archives of the mailing list will be available at
http://oss.sgi.com/projects/linux-mips/archive/.  Subscriptions are
be handled by majordomo@oss.sgi.com.

Subscribers of linuxmips@oss.sgi.com - that mailing list was only used
for internal purposes, that is to generate mailinglist archives of the
old linux@engr.sgi.com list.  While subscribing to it was possible it
was still a bad idea.  While you were receiving all postings to
linux@engr.sgi.com most of you were not subscribed to that list and
therefore not able to post.  Worse, your postings were going only to
the handfull of subscribers to that list.  Subscriptions to that list
have also all been moved over to linux-mips@oss.sgi.com

In case of problems please send mail to linux-mips-owner@oss.sgi.com
or me.

  Ralf
