Oh they did a very professional hatchet job. But then these are the people
who are responsible for a whole pile of such things.

They picked a kernel carefully chosen to have an NT TCP performance 
interoperability bug. They mistuned the linux box completely. They claim
to have checked on the net but mindscape never touched the linux.org.uk
web site since 1998

etc.

Whats very funny of course is Microsoft's Halloween II document is one of
the many things that contradicts this survey
