Hi,

That's all good and well, except the software that installs
these damn things appears to require 'ls' (since it's usually
a reasonable assumption that it'll be there). I tried to
install the necessary tardist but the program screamed and
died.

I would have expected the installer to be more independant,
in case IRIX newbies (like moi) fuck up so badly.

I still prefer Linux >:))
