It's probably not too late to improve this since those are
likely used only in-tree. Vendor GPL bundles provide some more
documentation for this setting, as does the FreeBSD source tree:
https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/master/sys/contrib/octeon-sdk/cvmx-asxx-defs.h#L911

But reading that, I think it could be still difficult to change it to
rx-delay-ps as it seems to be too coarse/unreliable.

The default is to set both to 16 on CN50XX and 24 on other chips.
