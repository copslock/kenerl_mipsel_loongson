Hello, OSS @ SGI gang--

I need a little help, please!  As a result of a company closing, I've
received a pair of SGI Origin 200 servers.  Unfortunately, since the
support contract on them has expired, I can't seem to use any of the
support services at www.sgi.com.

I'm just a home experimenter who wants to run the things 'til they die.
I'm very pleased with the performance, software, etc., and I'm very
familiar with them (as I worked on them 8 hrs / day for a year and a
half until the office closed).

The only difficulty is that these things are LOUD!  I'd like to find out
if there are any temperature monitors inside the thing, and if I can run
the fans at a reduced speed, or remove some of the fans to make them
reasonable in a home environment.  They don't do a lot (as I just do
some CPU-intensive stuff on them every once in a while, and very little
disk-I/O).

Thus, I'd like to find a contact for simple (but technical) hardware
questions like these on the Origin 200.  If you guys could send me a
friendly contact or two, I'd be very grateful.

(I'm also interested in making the thing dual-boot Irix & Linux, if the
Linux port is close to operating...  I've also got a pair of Indys that
I'm planning on sacrificing to the Linux gods...)

Thanks in advance--
