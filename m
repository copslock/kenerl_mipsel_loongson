ahhh, yes this is some of the stuff I was looking for, but...

I don't suppose you have the postscript and other docs that are
referenced by the web pages? example:
  http://www.unidial.com/~neuroinc/64-bit/psCh0.htm#Preface

Alan, if you can do this so Ulf can make them available then that
would be wonderfull.

What we really need to find out what happend to mipsabi.org and put
their stuff somewhere permananently s.a. oss.sgi or even one of the
linux or cygnus sites.
