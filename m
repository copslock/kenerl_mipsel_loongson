Hello List,

I know this is a little off topic, but I'd really
Appreciate it if anyone could give me a little pointer
In the right direction...

I am looking for a device which will allow me to burn
FLASH chips connected to the Alchemy through its JTAG port.

I am not looking for a complete JTAG function, I am just
Interested in re-flashing already soldered FLASH chips.


Thanks a lot,
Gilad.
