      I am interested too, but I would rather have two lists, just as
we normally do for regular development (sgi.bugs.xxx for bug reports and
checkins about xxx, sgi.engr.xxx for general discussion about xxx).  
Why don't you set up linux-progress as a clone of linux to start, and 
people who tire of the reports can unsubscribe from the linux-progress.
Having a separate list will also make a little easier to search the
archives later on.
