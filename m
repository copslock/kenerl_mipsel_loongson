Ocelot G was on my to be grilled list as posted a while ago I think. I
just created a wiki page for it, so it's now widely visible as death
candidate.

I'd do the same for the EV64120 - but I know nothing about that board, I
haven't heared of anybody trying to use, so it's a candidate as well.

Could anybody out there who knows enough to write a quick description of
the EV64120 write a quick wiki page?  Thanks :-)
