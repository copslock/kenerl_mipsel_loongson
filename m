Hello folks,

	I am actually inquiring on a similar note. I have an Indigo 
R3000 under my desk that is collecting dust. Firstly, I would like to 
port a linux kernel to this system. I am sort of a newbie to porting 
os's. So, I have a few questions that I would like to ask:

1. Is there someone out there working on a port to the R3000's 
Indigo's? If so, does someone know who it is or a link to a 
website??? etc ...

2. Since I am rather new to porting, is there a resource that you 
folks would suggest out there on the internet that would be a good 
starting point for information or tips on the best porting methods?

Any help would be greatly appreciated,
Mike
