Ok.

Also a possibility. Right now nothing using this will have off-stack cpu
masks I was just attempting to be cautious by handling the case anyway.
I'll change it one way or another for v2.

No, the generated code actually counts the number of VPEs which have
entered the generated code so that it knows it's safe to proceed to
disable coherence (which would of course be bad if any VPE was still
running C code). That count (nc_ready_count) has to equal online
(including the current CPU/VPE) & the final VPE goes on to disable
coherence whilst the others just halt.

Right, we don't care which CPU/VPE disables coherence or which one
re-enables coherence. However when one of them does so it does affect
the rest. So although they could stay idle it's a question of *which*
idle state they're now in. As soon as one VPE has left the idle state
the rest would now be in a coherent wait state. If they don't wake up
then cpuidle continues to believe they are in non-coherent wait.

I'm sure the driver could keep the coherent vs non-coherent
differentiation internally, but my point is that the governor would no
longer have access to it. That may or may not be a big issue, but one
other thing to bear in mind is that as I mentioned in the commit message
non-coherent wait is very much just a stepping stone towards entering
lower power states (clock gating or power gating the cores). Those lower
power states also require treating VPEs within a core as coupled, and
whilst the secondary ones could run a wait instruction on resume that
would be to further detriment of the residency statistics.

I'm unsure how that would help here - could you explain what you mean?
