How much pain is involved in netbooting a kernel from an INDY?  Can I
just setup a /tftpboot area with the appropriate files and setup a
place to place the kernels for the bootloader to find and it'll work?
If so, can someone tell me what the necessary magic is that needs to
be done?

This would speed up my development tremendously ;)

Later,
