I see, thanks.  That would probably make it hard to bisect indeed.

That's a reasonable guess, but I don't think so.  I do have PATA_AMD
enabled as a module indeed, but it's not even loaded, much as I can
tell, whereas PATA_CS5536 is built into the kernel image, and dmesg
says:

[    4.460000] scsi host0: pata_cs5536
[    4.464000] scsi host1: pata_cs5536
[    4.464000] ata1: PATA max UDMA/100 cmd 0x1f0 ctl 0x3f6 bmdma 0x4c60 irq 14
[    4.464000] ata2: DUMMY
[    4.464000] pcnet32: [...]
[    4.644000] random: [...]
[    5.908000] irq 14: nobody cared (try booting with the "irqpoll" option)


Just to be sure, I added some printks to cs5536_noop_freeze, and here's
what I got in dmesg instead:

[    4.452000] pata_cs5536: freeze: checking status...
[    4.452000] pata_cs5536: freeze: checked, clearing...

[    4.652000] random: [...]
[    5.920000] irq 14: nobody cared (try booting with the "irqpoll" option)

now, maybe I just don't understand what effects the patch was supposed
to have.

The system still feels very slow, but I haven't timed anything; could it
be that it had the effect of keeping the IRQ functional after all, but
5.0-rc6 is slower than earlier kernels for other reasons?  Like,
/proc/irq/14/pata_cs5536/ is there, but I haven't checked whether it was
there before the patch.

Do you suggest any way to tell whether it had the intended effect?
