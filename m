That's proposed code and has absolutely nothing to do with the
existing trace point semantics.

You can repeat that as often as you want, it does not make it more
true. Fact is that the decision is made in the middle of the perf code.

The tracepoint is called for observation reasons and now you make it a
decision function. That's what I call abuse.

Hahaha, they still have to run through the additional code when
seccomp is enabled and we still have to propagate the return value
down to the point where the tracepoint itself is. You call that not
affected?

There is no way to do it cleanly. It always comes for the price that
you add additional code into the tracing code path. And there are
other people who try hard to remove stuff to recude the overhead which
is caused by instrumentation.

We have enough places where different independent parts of the kernel
want to hook into for obvious reasons.

We have notifiers for those where performance does not matter much and
we have separate calls into the independent functions where it matters
or where we need to evaluate the results in specific ways.

So now you turn instrumentation into a security mechanism, which
"works" nicely for a particular purpose, i.e. decision on a particular
syscall number. Now, how do you make that work when a decision has to
be made on more than a simple match, e.g. syscall number + arguments ?

Not at all, unless you add more complexity and arbitrary callbacks
into the instrumentation code.

Well, I'm interested in security, but I'm neither interested in
security decisions inside instrumentation code nor in security models
which are limited hacks by definition unless you want to add callback
complexities to the instrumentation code.

It all looks nice and charming with this minimalistic use case, but
add real features to it and it gets messy in a split second and you
can't hold that off once you started to allow A. And you clearly
stated that you want to have more trace point based security features
than the simple syscall number filtering.

> I think we want fewer ABIs and more flexible/reusable facilities.

I'm all for that, but security and instrumentation are different
beasts.

Right, that requires callbacks and more stuff to do object based
observation and ties a trace point into a place where it might not
make sense after a while, but the security decision wants to stay at
that place. The syscall example is so tempting because it's simplistic
and easy to solve, but every extension to that model is going to
create a nightmare.

You are duct taping stuff together which has totally different
semantics and requirements. And your only argument is reuse of
existing code. That's a good argument in principle, but there is a
fundamental difference between intelligent reuse and enforcing it just
for reuse sake.

By making a total mess out of it?

Right. And this falls into the category of over-integration. We have
people working on security and they are working on stacked security
models, so where is the justification to start another security
framework inside the instrumentation code which is completely non
interoperable with the existing ones?

> If anything then that should tell you something that events and

They happen to have the hook at the same point in the source and for
pure coincidence it works because the problem to solve is extremly
simplistic. And that's why the diffstat is minimalistic, but that does
not prove anything.
