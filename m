This is once again turning into an advocacy war.

We all at some point want to see the same thing, Linux on SGI. Some people are
raging Linux advocates that think its the best thing since sliced bread and
that all other OSs are inherently a Bad Thing[TM], others think it would just
be neat/interesting thing to do. Others may even think that it could possible
damage our competative advantage if we make too much of our hardware details
public.

Unfortunetly, the people that maybe able to help us often fall into the last
category.

If you want a favour from someone you don't start my telling them that what
they've worked on for the last x years is dead and your way is the future.
