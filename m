The FSF already has a copyright assignment for my GDB work however David
to my knowledge never assigned his code to the FSF nor as he did this
work during his internship at SGI do I know if SGI still has any rights
on his work.  Unfortunately by now I fear David's and my work is tangled
in a way that we won't be able to distinguish who wrote what to the degree
required by the FSF ...

David, can you comment?
