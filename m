There's a web-based archive here:

http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-mips&r=1&w=2

but it looks like it isn't archiving all of the messages.

You can get the mail archive files directly from sgi here:

http://oss.sgi.com/mips/archive/

You can download a file, place it in the directory where your
Email package stores its folders, and it should appear as
a normal folder in most Email packages.

These arechives are a gold mine to anyone doing Mips development,
with or without Linux as the OS.
