	Actually I suspect the exact opposite would happen and hence
management's fear.  There are ALOT more people in the linux community 
than we have working at SGI.  It is very concievable that if the specs
were
available linux on O2 would massively out perform irix on the O2.  This
would
be a major embarrassment to the company.  Compare and contrast as Unixes
Solaris X86 and Linux on a given x86 box or Digital Unix and linux on an
alpha.

	Quality wise free software always beats proprietary software (if for
no other reason than it has to make fewer concesions to release
schedules
and politics) often embarassingly so.
