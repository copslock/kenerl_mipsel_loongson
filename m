Unfortunately, the download link for that manual on mips.com seems to be
broken.

Ok, I'll do that.

This is the new code:

static inline void cpu_set_vmbits(struct cpuinfo_mips *c)
{
        if (cpu_has_64bits) {
                write_c0_entryhi(0xfffffffffffff000ULL);
                c->vmbits = __fls(read_c0_entryhi() &
0x3ffffffffffff000ULL) + 1;
        } else
                c->vmbits = 32;
}
