Actually this would probably put the companies using I20 specs in a very
similar position that many of the big unix workstation vendors find
themself in now. What more, if Linux did (it will I'm sure) run on this
architecture it would put itself in a great position, espiecially if
Microsoft stop supporting the old architecture while other companies
continue to produce them. (How badly does Bill Gates want it to go his
way?)
