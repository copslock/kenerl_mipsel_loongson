Where did you get your system from?  I maybe looking for one in the near
future to do some development on.  If anyone else knows where I can get one
at a reasonable price can you email me....

Thanks
Marc

Hi,
	I have come into possesion of the SGI Indy Workstation with a R5000
processor.

I have been going thorugh a number of site that I could find and have found
a number of out of date distribution, and have manage to get the simple
distribution partially working.

If someone could point me to a resonable distribution I would be
grateful....

Jason
