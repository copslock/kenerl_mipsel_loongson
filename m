Hi Linuxies,

So soon the port will be "over".

What's next?

Can we turn this from a neat hacker's adventure into
something really beneficial to SGI?

Thanks to Larry and David, I started collecting some
thoughts in:

	http://info.engr/linux/next-step.html


P.S. I also talked to some people who oppose all this
so I made their voices heard in:

	http://info.engr/linux/skeptic.html

I hope you'll find these two mildly interesting.
I wish TJ could join us in this new endeavor.

Any constructive input is as always welcome.
