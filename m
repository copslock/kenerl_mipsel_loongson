Well, last I know, Linux/SGI isn't supposed to run on Challenge "S"
machines.  Is that true?  Anyway, I've got one that a customer has lent
me (it has a bad hard drive, but I'm going to get a new 2 gig to put in
there) and I was wondering if there was anything I could do (as far as
giving out accounts on it if/when I get Linux or IRIX on it) in order to
help the Linux/SGI effort.  Thanks!

Mark
