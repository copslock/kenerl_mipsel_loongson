Kaffe is the only "free" Java for MIPS/Linux that I have worked with.
There may be others, but if you don't mind paying for it, your options
would include the Insignia Jeode technology is now owned by
Esmertec (www.esmertec.com), and Skelmir's CEE-J (www.skelmir.com).
I have run both of these successfully on MIPS/Linux platforms.
