To whom it may concern...

It seems that tere have been a recent surge in people who
want to try SGI/Linux on their Indy's.  Unfortunately, despite
having about 10 people already running Linux on their SGIs
we still don't have a really easy, complete, up-to-date,
and straightforward doc on how to get there...

For example:

	ftp://ftp.linux.sgi.com/pub/mips-linux/GettingStarted/README

says that Linux-installer-0.1.tar.gz is broken.

root-be-0.00.cpio.gz is old, and root-be-0.02.tar.gz is untested.

The FAQ/HOWTO is very old an inaccurate and has broken links:

	http://www.linux.sgi.com/faq.html


Please, could someone who feel confident with this stuff step
forward and make the necessary changes to the web/ftp site so we
can have people join the trailblazers easily?   Every minute
invested in this as opposed to hacking the code would be a much
better investment in terms of more people joining and keeping
the momentum of this project.

Thanks!
