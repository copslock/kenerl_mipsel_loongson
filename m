A while back someone mentioned that they were doing some
work on the mips64 SMP front to seperate the ip27 specific
code from the platform-independent code.  I'm doing some similar
things and would like to coordinate, but I can't find the original
mail, nor remember who the sender was.

So, anyone doing stuff like this, I'd enjoy hearing from you.
