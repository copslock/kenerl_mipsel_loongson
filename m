I am still getting bus errors while doing a full install of x... the 
build is ok, but it errors out when it loads up xkbcomp and starts using 
it.  I am at a complete loss, and I'm really willing to use binaries / 
packages..  This time, i'm building with glibc-2.2.1 (base and dev) and 
gcc 2.97.  Can anyone offer any help?
