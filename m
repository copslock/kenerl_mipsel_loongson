Hi everybody, I just want to install linux on an Indy,
I asked before about running X with linux, and someone 
answered me that I could be done not natively but running
the Xsgi server or something like that, my question is,
where can I obtain information about this???

My last question is, can you give me some recommendations
about my installation on the Indy, I mean, what to download
and all that stuff, I think the SGI/Linux pages are a little
bit outdated, I could help updating them but first I need
to play more with it :-)

Any help will be gladly appreciated

Thanks
natorro
