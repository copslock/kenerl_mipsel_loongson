Unfortunately, the research of original case is still needed.
I looked into all cases of update_mmu_cache() besides HUGE page support 
and NUMA, and I see:

1.  insert_pfn()
     It is used to put a special page (read - VDSO) into memory map. No 
cache flush is needed here because page is done and flushed during 
system boot.

2.  do_wp_page(), first occurrence
     It has flush_cache_page() before it sets PTE in 
ptep_set_access_flags(). This flush is unconditional and affects all caches.

3.  do_wp_page(), second case
     It is done after preparing a clear new page or after COW. COW has 
an appropriate cache flush of destination in copy_user_highpage(). The 
immediate use of cleared new page as instruction (you had SIGILL, 
right?)... hm-m, something wrong in application in this case.

4.  do_swap_page()
     Well, it may be a case of flush_icache_page() is not used (see 
below) and page is taken from non-DMA swap. But I also recommend to look 
into

         http://patchwork.linux-mips.org/patch/7615/

there is a bug in swap entry number presentation and it may affect your 
system.

5.  do_anonymous_page()
     The similar to case (3) - cleared new page, using of it as 
instruction page may point to some app problem.

6.  do_set_pte()
     It also has flush_icache_page() which may have impact if not 
implemented, see below.

7.  handle_pte_fault()
     Page is not touched and cache flush is NO-OP.

8.  remove_migration_pte()
     Well, it is a place for suspicion. But it should not run in 
parallel with any running thread - dirtying page while other thread is 
running is a way to disaster.

So, you see - if I understand it correctly, there is no place for 
failure... besides application misbehaviour or potential kernel bug in 
migration. Of course, I may miss something and that is a reason why 
stack trace is desirable.

As I remember, you said you use HIGHMEM patch, right? It changes a 
little __flush_dcache_page() and flush of any mapped page is not 
postponed anymore. So, it has an immediate effect for application pages.
