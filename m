Even more important than Linux being easier to install than NT is 
reliability.  I am in the middle of a project to remove about $200,000
worth of NT servers and replace them with Linux boxes.  Of the servers
installed thus far, we've seen our incidence of problems go from about 2
a week to zero (and peformance boasts out the wazoo).

I'm currently working on an article for LJ about our project and how to do
it yourself.  The possibly of Linux as an NT replacement is not only real,
it's happening.
