Alright.  I'm reading the newport documentation, and I've come across a
lot of things I just don't understand.

Here are a couple of pointed questions:

- What is a span, and how does it differ from a line?

- is the usable area *really* 5439x5120 pixels?  this strikes me as
incredibly fine ( from page 26)

- what's the interface between Alan's sgifb and the kernel supposed to be?
What required functions are there?

- can someone give me a moron's guide to what an iterator is?


- Alex
