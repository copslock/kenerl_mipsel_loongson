Going to link

http://www.jp.playstation.com/linux/dmesg.html

I see that bogo mips are reported as :

Calibrating delay loop... 392.40 BogoMIPS
Estimated CPU clock:  294.240 MHz

I thought the PS2 was a dual pipelined processor and
so maybe would see a higher BogoMIPS figure ? Possibly
double ?

Anybody know the ins and outs of this ?

Wayne
