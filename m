The register description for TCSRn.PWM_EN reads:

	1: PWM pin output enable
	0: PWM pin output disable, and the PWM pin will be set to the
	   initial level according to INITL

As I read the manual (but that differes from the driver) you should use
INITL=1 for an uninverted PWM such that the period starts with the
output being 1. And with that I'd expect that the output goes high on
disable. Given that the driver inverts this and sets INITL (called
JZ_TIMER_CTRL_PWM_ACTIVE_LOW in the driver) for an inverted pwm that
behaviour is ok. With this approach the bug is not the level when
pwm_disable was called but that the period doesn't start with the active
part of the period.

Then I think the right thing to do is to gracefully disable the hardware
on a duty/period change first to ensure the currently running period is
completed before the next configuration gets active.

That sounds backwards from your last mail and the reference manual. As I
read the manual "graceful" means the period is completed until FULL
matches. And I understand "aprupt" as "immediatly freeze". If this is
the case the names in the manual are well chosen.

For the pwm framework the intended behaviour is the graceful one. (For
both, disable and duty/period change.)

Best regards
Uwe
