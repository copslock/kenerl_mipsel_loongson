No, I am adding DT support.  For that I need a working 
irq_create_of_mapping() for non-GPIO interrupts.  I am also adding GPIO, 
but that is not the part giving us problems.

You may recall that in an earlier e-mail you asked me to use irq_domain 
support for my irq_create_of_mapping() rather than my previous ad hoc 
approach.  I agree that this is a good idea, and now we are here.

Granted, the non-GPIO support for irq_create_of_mapping() and GPIO 
support could be separated into two patches, but that is somewhat of an 
orthogonal issue.  Since that part is isolated in arch/mips, Ralf and I 
can discuss doing that.  For now I would like to concentrate on figuring 
out if it is advantageous to adjust the irq_domain core implementation.

Yes, let's do that.  It is clouding the issue.

This is precisely the issue, and what patch 1/2 is doing.

My Patch 2/2 was just included to show how I would be using the changes.

Yes, this is essentially correct.

There are two iterators defined:

1) irq_domain_each_hwirq()

2) irq_domain_for_each_irq()

Yet struct irq_domain has only nr_irq, this clearly cannot be used as 
the range of both iterators.  Furthermore I think the concept of a 
linear iteration through irq values is fundamentally broken.

?? I don't get what you mean.  They are clearly separate concepts, my 
interrupt controller code even goes as far as having a map to translate 
between the two.

Indeed I am, but its only effect is to introduce an additional hole 
(among many others) in the irq number space of the primary controller. 
It is only tangentially related to the real issues of this discussion.

Ok, now we are getting somewhere.

However I am not sufficiently clever to design an iteration macro like 
irq_domain_for_each_irq(), that would use the return value of zero from 
.to_irq to determine if we should continue to the next hwirq value 
without entering the body of the loop.

I am left with my callback iterator thing that is in the patch 1/2.

> I don't think .each_hwirq is being used, so you can delete that.

Yes, I noticed that.  There are two options:

1) Remove it as you suggest, along with irq_domain_for_each_hwirq() and 
irq_domain_each_hwirq().

2) Leave it on the grounds that irq_domain_for_each_hwirq() is there for 
a reason.
