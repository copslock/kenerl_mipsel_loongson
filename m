Asking the same question over and over again is very anoying - A couple
of people have answered already that ANY SCSI Drive/CD-Rom will do fine
but it doesnt seem to reach the originator.

There have been lists concerning all aspects of SGI Systems
which should be called sgi-managers IIRC. 

This list is called "linux-mips" and from my opinion it deals
with the aspects of the Mips Port of Linux. And i dont
think that SCSI questions fall into that category.
As i already said - I am not annoyed by single Off-Topic mails
but repeated questions (read: forwarding of sell advertisements)
is not really something concerning the topic.

     Why is it called "common sense" when nobody seems to have any?
