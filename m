I didn't know about your page, but I knew most of the stuff on your page. I have
been reading that DDX guide, but I didn't know where to find the "Strategies of
Porting guide", it didn't come with the X sources AFAIK. I still prefer reading
it in ASCII on screen, do you know where I can find an untroffed version of it?

By the way, I have access to the XFree86 4.0 alpha (beta?) sources since I'm
member of the XFree86 crew.

Full support would never be easy, and I'm not heading for that in the beginning,
although it would be faster, I would probably end up with nothing at all in the
end..

I'll let you know if I have any progress.

Thanks,
