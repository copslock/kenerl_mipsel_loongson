Some of you may have already noticed; I replaced the old homepage of
linux-mips.org which was generated from the same sources as the
Linux/MIPS Howto by a wiki at http://www.linux-mips.org.  The wiki's
currently 82 pages including a somewhat updated version of Jun Sun's
Porting Linux document and inspite of the young age of the wiki it
should already have bypassed the old documents in quantity, readability,
up-to-dateness.

Check it out, post what you think about the wiki.  Most importantatly
write many nice new articles :-)
