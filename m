Understood. However I did test your patch, but it was generating
spurious IRQs and overruns (ttyS ttyS2: 91 input overrun(s)) on the
AM335x, so that's not a proper solution.

I even brought the CI20 V2 I have back to life (yes, I bought one). The
patch Ezequiel posted did fix the problem on the CI20, and did not break
the AM335x, so I'd prefer if it was revisited instead of a heavy-handed
revert.

And I'd prefer to keep this thread alive, since I am still convinced
that the FIFO handling code is wrong. Moreover, considering the UME bit
on JZ4780 in FCR, the original code should confuse the UART on the
JZ4780 too, although this might be hidden by some other surrounding code
specific to the 8250 core on the JZ4780.

I am also on mipslinux IRC channel, in case you want to discuss this.
