You will be glad to know that the memory will be available from 3rd parties.

Some of what you need may be bundled.  Take a look at the interoperability
kit that is bundled which includes a lot of what you mentioned.

What system bus?  The FSB is the same, otherwise the off the shelf CPUs
(which I assume you will by 3rd party :) ) won't work.  Our memory
controller is lower latency than the 440xx and has huge bandwidth from
memory to the controller.  Both of these (mostly the latency) will show
on FP performance when you break cache.

Really? :)

The small little CAD/CAM market. :)
If we get that back then we will build all the Linux/IRIX boxes you
need.

Thanks for your perspective though.
