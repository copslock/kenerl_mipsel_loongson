I would say more than just that :) I picked few quotes which in my
reading represent the guys positions:

Tejun Heo: "...do we really
care about possible partial success?  This sort of interface is
unnecessarily complex and actively harmful.  It forces all users to
wonder what could possibly happen and implement all sorts of nutty
fallback logic which is highly likely to be error-prone on both the
software and hardware side.  Seriously, how much testing would such
code path would get both on the driver and firmware sides?"

Bjorn Helgaas: "I agree, that would be much simpler.
I propose that you rework it that way, and at least find out what
(if anything) would break if we do that."

Michael Ellerman: "I really think you're overstating the complexity here.
Functions typically return a boolean   -> nothing to see here
This function returns a tristate value -> brain explosion!";
"All a lot of bother for no real gain IMHO."

> But you have a counter-example, so I'm not sure what your point is.

I concur with Tejun. I think we need to get rid of the loop.

As of the counter-example I think we could honour the pSeries quota by
inroducing an interface to interrogate what you call global limits -
pci_get_msix_limit(), i.e.:

	rc = pci_msix_table_size(pdev, nvec);
	if (rc < 0)
		return rc;

	nvec = min(rc, nvec);

	rc = pci_get_msix_limit(pdev, nvec);
	if (rc < 0)
		return rc;

	nvec = min(rc, nvec);

	for (i = 0; i < nvec; i++)
		msix_entry[i].entry = i;

	rc = pci_enable_msix(pdev, msix_entry, nvec);
	if (rc)
		return rc;

The latest state of those discussion is somewhere around Michael's:
"We could probably make that work." and Tejun's: "Are we talking about
some limited number of device drivers here? Also, is the quota still
necessary for machines in production today?"

So my point is - drivers should first obtain a number of MSIs they *can*
get, then *derive* a number of MSIs the device is fine with and only then
request that number. Not terribly different from memory or any other type
of resource allocation ;)

Well, I do not know how to comment here. 2.6.18 has a significantly
different codebase wrt MSIs. What about a recent version?

I think such interface is redundant wrt the current pci_enable_msix()
implementation.. and you propose to leave it. IMO it unnecessarily blows
the generic MSI API with no demand from drivers.

Although the classes of drivers you specified indeed exist, I do believe
just a single interface is enough to handle them all.
