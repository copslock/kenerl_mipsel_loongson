Okay, so after a week of downtime due to hardware failure on another machine, I
started looking at this again, and it looks like it's more than just getting
the windows wrong.  The existing BRIDGE code (pci-bridge.c) is limiting the PCI
window to the first five devices on BaseIO in the small window (my fault), and
the IP30 glue code (ip30-bridge.c) is re-writing the PCI BARs to access the
BRIDGE PCI Memory and PCI I/O spaces via big windows, without updating the
original mapping.  We're not teaching the Linux PCI core at all, I think, about
how to generically access PCI Memory Space and PCI I/O Space on the BRIDGE.
The fact this actually works appears to be pure luck.

Quoting from the BRIDGE docs somewhat, from the point of view of generic
Crosstalk space and not specific to IP30 or IP27, there are several views into
PCI space.  Each address is 48-bits, the size of a Crosstalk address.

    0000_0000_0000 to 0000_00ff_ffff is "Widget space".  It seems the BRIDGE
    docs use the term "widget" here to refer to the eight possible PCI devices
    addressable by a single BRIDGE ASIC.  This plus the small windows is how
    the code is currently getting things to work.  I think.

    0000_4000_0000 to 0000_7fff_ffff is BRIDGE's view into PCI Memory Space
    for direct-mapped 32-bit devices.  It is 1GB in size.  My take is this is
    normally a 4GB space?  Can the Linux PCI core be taught that only 1GB
    is usable?

    0000_8000_0000 to 0000_bfff_ffff is an alias view by BRIDGE into PCI
    Memory space for 64-bit PCI devices, immediately after the 32-bit space.
    It is also 1GB in size.

    0000_c000_0000 to 0000_ffff_ffff is 2GB adjacent to PCI Memory space, but
    is either unused or used for Crosstalk/BRIDGE DMA operations
    (the docs aren't very clear on this point or I am simply not
    understanding).

    0001_0000_0000 to 0001_ffff_ffff is BRIDGE's view into PCI I/O Space.
    It has the entire 4GB range available to use.


I suspect the existing BRIDGE driver is mapping through "widget space" first to
probe the PCI device slots, then the ip30-bridge.c code is re-writing the PCI
BARs to go through the big window on IP30, but it never updates the original
BRIDGE setup (if that's even possible).  As such, as you pointed out, there's
some kind of logic in the generic PCI core that's re-assigning space from the
window and we're just getting lucky and everything still works.

I dug up some old debugging code given to me by the original author of the IP30
port and built up a set of macros that get me to the PCI Configuration Space on
Widget 0xf (BaseIO Bridge), Device #0 (the first QLA1040B SCSI controller).
All three addresses access the same PCI device and return the same config space
info.

    Small window:  0x900000001f02xxxx
    Medium window: 0x9000000f8002xxxx
    Big window:    0x900000f00002xxxx


Each additional device's configuration space is offset 0x1000, which gives me
the following addresses (dev's 4 to 7 are special-cased for IRQ trickery, so
can't probe them):

    - Dev #0: scsi0/qla1040b: 0x90xxxxxxxxx20000
    - Dev #1: scsi1/qla1040b: 0x90xxxxxxxxx21000
    - Dev #2: io/ioc3       : 0x90xxxxxxxxx22000
    - Dev #3: audio/rad1    : 0x90xxxxxxxxx23000


If I probe and dump the config space data for each, I get the following:

This is where my knowledge runs short -- I'm not fluent in PCI device
programming, so I'm not sure what is really supposed to be going on with these
different BAR regions.  I dug up a copy of the PCI Spec 2.2, but it's 322 pages
and I'm not sure where I should start reading from.  Are these regions
device-specific?  E.g., do I need the QLA1040B programming manual to understand
why region 0 is 0x00200001 and region 1 is 0x00200000?

I am also not yet considering how PCI views Crosstalk space for DMA operations
-- BRIDGE has several mechanisms for that, depending on if the PCI device is a
32-bit device or a 64-bit device.  It can do direct-mapping for 32-bit or
64-bit, or built-in page-mapping hardware is available (but apparently to be
avoided due to numerous hardware quirks/bugs that would make the driver
overly-complicated).

There's a good write-up in the OpenBSD "xbridge" driver, which handles BRIDGE
(IP27/IP30), XBRIDGE (IP35), and PIC (IP35/IA64 Altix):

It's starting to make some sense to me, but I am still uncertain how to work
with the 32-bit and 64-bit 1GB PCI memory spaces on BRIDGE as well as the 4GB
PCI I/O space from a Linux point of view.  Do they only matter when dealing
with DMA?
