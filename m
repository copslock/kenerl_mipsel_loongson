As I told you in a private mail some time ago ;-),
all info about linux on DECStations can be found at:
http://www.xs4all.nl/~vhouten/mipsel

The 5000/25 should work OK, the 2100/3100 might have some problems
with the current kernels.
The VAX station is not a MIPS cpu, but a vax.

The box said "Requires Windows 95 or better."
I can't understand why it won't work on my Linux computer.
