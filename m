Hello,

I was just gifted/given an Indigo 2.

It's working so I don't need any parts but I do want to know what the status
of the hardhat project is. The files I found on the sgi site seemed out of
date. Is any progress being made here?

How soon till I can install linux without having IRIX on my harddrive? All
of the FAQs/docs I could find seemed to have IRIX as a requirement to
partition the HD properly.

Thanks!
