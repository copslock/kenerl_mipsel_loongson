I was under the impression that MIPS was doing pretty well.  Someone
correct me if I am wrong, but I remember reading that the vast majority of
MIPS chips wound up in things other than SGI computers (i.e. Sony
Playstation, Nintendo 64's, etc.).  

>From what I read about the R12K, MIPS would appear to be near the top of
the CPU game as far as raw procesing power.  When compared to a Pentium-II
350 MHz, a 300MHz R12K was about equal in integer ops and nearly 5 times
the speed with floating point ops.  It's not an Alpha, but it far better
than anything cooked up at Intel.  (ok, maybe I am a little biased, but
real men use RISC).
