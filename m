Hi,

Just a short note to indicate that while working on v4, I realized this 
series had a some issues:

- I broke the case ARCH_HAS_ELF_RANDOMIZE selected but not
   ARCH_WANT_DEFAULT_TOPDOWN_MMAP_LAYOUT (which can happen on arm 
without MMU for example)
- I use mmap_rnd_bits unconditionnally whereas it might not be defined 
(it works for all arches I moved though)

The only clean solution I found for the first problem is to propose a 
common implementation for arch_randomize_brk
and arch_mmap_rnd, which is another series on its own and another good 
cleanup since every architecture uses
the same functions (except ppc, but that can be workarounded easily).
Just like moving x86 deserves its own series since it adds up 8/9 commits.
I am on vacations for 2 weeks, so I won't have time to submit another 
patchset before, sorry about that.

Thanks,

Alex
