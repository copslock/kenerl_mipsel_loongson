I am very much against renamings, for several reasons. As Paul already mentioned, it's pointless and just adds noise to the git-log, making history harder to recover. Driver file names don't really have to reflect the device exactly. For the compatibility list, it's far easier to just git-grep for compatible strings, or git-grep Documentation and/or Kconfig.

Renaming macros and register names, is equally pointless and equally git-history invasive. Simply adding some documentation is enough.
