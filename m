Girish,

It is.  But I believe that video chip companies have the chip designer
and the BIOS/Windows driver developer working at adjacent desks.  If
you knew everything they'd ever said to each other, then there would
be no need for an x86 emulator.

We thought the x86 emulator was simpler; and evidently so did the MILO
people...
