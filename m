Concerning a previous message you can find relative information
about the Mungi OS and most importantly about the motivation
of it's design at their archive of Technical Reports. Especially a
paper called "Single Address Space Operating Systems" seems
to be quite informative (available at:
ftp://ftp.cse.unsw.edu.au/pub/doc/papers/UNSW/9504.ps.Z)

Single-Address-Space OS seems to offer many advantages for
modern systems design  (aka. 64-bit computer architectures)
and it can also support a POSIX compliant interface. However,
are there any drawbacks of such an implementation ? Any one ?
