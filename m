As the FAQ states, this box should work fine.  Graphics hardware will
be supported when documentation is available or someone manages to
reverse-engineer it.  Perhaps you'd like to volunteer?

The install is a trivial matter for experienced hackers, an annoyance
to people who've never strayed outside the chartered bounds of
commercial Linux on peecees, and a source of unending pain and grief
for newbies.  Unfortunately it's getting easier all the time.
