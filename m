It is nice to see interest in Linux from big SGI customers
(and I wish there was more of this :-)

I'll second Ralf.  Once we have an Indy port that's stable,
easy to install and maybe supported by Red-Hat or other
Linux distributors. Once we have something that's actually used
by many Indy owners (rather than just a handful), and once SGI
real customers (who bring SGI real money) seem to like it and
talk to their SGI reps about their interest in Linux on SGI,
only then, management may be open to opening more HW specs
to the public.

I believe there are a few hundreds of thousands Indy's out there.
If we can make one in ten of them (10%) switch to Linux, it would be
a great achievement and one that would certainly be noted
by everyone at SGI, including those who can approve releasing
further specs.

And let's not waste too many resources on the N64 port either :-)

As Mao Zedong used to say... hint, hint, nudge, nudge.
