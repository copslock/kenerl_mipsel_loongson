You missed the point - I like to see some open discussions before any big 
changes to MIPS.  If you look back of all the significant changes made to the 
MIPS tree, you will see a high percentage of them went in without any open 
discussion or pre-warning.  It is this context that brought out :-(.  Not your 
patch per se.

Once in while I hop into other communities.  I get a feeling they appear to be 
doing better than us in this regard.  And I like that feeling.
