I am trying to build Gcc mips cross compiler. I want to use this for
compiling 2.4.0 linux.
I also want to build libraries.

Which are the tar files i would need to download?
What is the sequence i should follow when building gcc cross compiler?

Information on this would be very helpful for me.

Thanks and Regards,
deepak
