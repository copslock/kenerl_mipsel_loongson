:Hi all,
:
:what do you think, should we open a new mailing list where everybody
:is allowed to subscribe.  Only the CVS commits and other important
:announcements are being posted?  This would help making the development
:more transparent by showing interested non-developers what's going on.

Ralf,

I believe we already have one, it was created by me when
David Miller was working here in the summer of 96:

	To: majordomo@engr.sgi.com
	subscribe linux-progress your@preferred.email.address

So just add linux-progress@engr.sgi.com to the CVS commit alias

[This should work for all the SGI internal interested parties
 not sure about external people...]

Peace, Ariel
