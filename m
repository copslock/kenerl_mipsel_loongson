Hi,

I am trying to Install Linux on an INDY, but due to lack of knowledge and me
being a bit of a newbie I am having problems.

I have a i386 server setup and as much documentation as I can find,

I am using the foobazco docs at the moment.

Could anyone point me in the right direction to solve the following problem.

Where do I find base.tar.gz ?

Thanks

Budgester
