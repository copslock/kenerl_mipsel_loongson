I see. Most importantly, changing the RE bit would be unsupportable by
Linux, because that would break our system call ABI: you can't have
kernel and user space running at different endianess.

Thanks for looking that up, that explains a lot!

What I meant is that you can't use the normal driver API. The __raw_*
accessors are in no way guaranteed to do what you want across
architectures, they may be missing barriers and the compiler is free
to reorder accesses or split up word accesses into byte accesses
for any reason. It's basically just a 'volatile' pointer dereference
that is meant to access device memory through an __iomem pointer.

I don't doubt that these accessors do the right thing for you on
MIPS, but that is because either the hardware or the definition
in source code puts more into them than the API guarantees.

Yes, based on your description above, that works. I'm just really
surprised about that kind of hardware design.

Yes, I can imagine the horror this must mean for hardware designers.
On systems where the hardware doesn't do any byte swaps, this is
no problem at all, the kernel just does the swaps in either
readl()/ioread32() or in ioread32be(), but not in ioread32_rep(),
which is used for repeated FIFO accesses.

Yes, definitely.
