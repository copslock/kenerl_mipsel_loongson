Nope, there is no externally visible DAI for the codec, but internally
it is connected through the i2s controller of the JZ4740 which supports
different operating modes. And if you'll do
"snd_soc_dai_set_fmt(codec_dai, BOARD_DAIFMT);
snd_soc_dai_set_fmt(cpu_dai, BOARD_DAIFMT);" with a wrong dai format it
will be noticed.

In theory the codec supports 18 bit for playback, but the i2s controller
requires it to be 32 bit aligned, while alsa appears to have only
support for a 24 bit aligned 18 bit format(Correct me if I'm wrong). So
I dropped it, I'll remove the whole format check in hw_params as Liam
suggested.

Uhm, actually this code path is taken when switching from _OFF to
another state. If it is guaranteed that _OFF is always followed by a
certain other state I could put the reset code in its part of the switch
statement.

Hm, I'll take a look.

I renamed the driver from jz-codec to jz4740-codec shortly before
submitting it after I realized that the codec component on other jz47xx
chips is completely different. Seems like I missed the codec name.

Thanks for reviewing the patch
