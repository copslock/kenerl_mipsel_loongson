Aha.

I have had occasional IRQ 14 issues over the years, but they were not
common, and they'd hit while using the system.  After 4.20, they seem to
deterministically hit very early during boot-up.

That's possible.  Another possibility is that it is related with the
hard drive models connected to the controller.  What suggested this to
me was the quirks code in the old, non-libata driver, that recognized
specific hard drive models, one of which matches the drive I have on my
yeeloong.

$ hdparm -i /dev/sda
[...]
 Model=FUJITSU MHZ2160BH G2, FwRev=00000009, SerialNo=[...]

I don't have the PMON or EC versions in /proc/cmdline.  machtype is the same.

'vers' in the pmon text prompt responds: PMON2000 2.1 (Bonito) #291

> $ cat /proc/interrupts 

Differences (running 4.19) are IRQ 5, and USBs on 11 (XT) and 39 (bonito).

Err, should I be worried that I have that too?
