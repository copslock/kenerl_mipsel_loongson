Alright.  Just to get the ball rolling I've put root-be-0.02.tar.gz in the
GettingStarted directory.  It's completely untested, as I'm a couple of
miles away from my favourite aqua coloured computer. It's about 4.5MB
compressed.

I'd appreciate it if people could tell me if things work before I get rid
