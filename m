Hello,

Hmmm, that doesn't sound promising. But do you have references
for that?
Maybe google has some more info than since I first started
searching.
Anyway: for now it happily runs debian, and for what I can see,
the kernel patches have no real changes except for extra drivers
and extra board and powermanagement drivers.
So if you have hints in which way the xburst deviates from
"standard" mips, it could help us a lot.
In the mean time I am going to subscribe to the ingenic forum
( http://www.ingenic.cn/eng/forum/vvFrmDefault.aspx )
that contains more characters that I can't read than characters
that I can read :-(.

Regards,
Ard
