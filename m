Hi, all,

I use mipsel-2.4.2 kernel and added udf into it. When the system is up,
I mount -t udf /dev/cdrom /mnt. And it is ok, but sometimes will
report {Drive Ready, Seek Complete}.
But when I cd /mnt, and ls, I could not find anything. Sometimes the
system is pause. My question is: Can mipsel linux support UDF?
My DVD-ROM can work well use iso9660 format. If someone knows,
Please help me. TIA
