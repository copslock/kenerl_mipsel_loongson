I tried again. The result is same. 
The green LED display shows 'LINUX' not 'LINUX on malta'. All the status LED
are green except the LED rst is off. There are 2 kernel images(el and eb),
one of them is vmlinux-2.2.12.mips.malta.eb-01.05.srec, which is the current
one. I double checked my console and its baud rate is 38400. 
  From this symptom, what kind of conclusion can you draw?

  Best regards,

  Yidan

Hmm, well, for a start, you can just boot like this:

go . console=ttyS0,38400

.. your boot isn't getting anywhere near far enough to care
about IP addresses and nfs root disks; Once you get far
enough to see a message about "attempting to mount root
file system" then you can start worrying about ip and nfsroot
arguments.

..take a look at the green 8-character display (U42). If it
is scrolling the text "linux on malta" then the kernel is
almost certainly up and running, and I would suspect your
serial port settings are wrong in your terminal emulator.
If not, check you're using a big-endian kernel for a malta.

that's all I can think of. Happy hunting

Neal.

Hi Neal,
  First, thanks a lot!
  Second, I tried as you mentioned, but the result is still same--screens of
rubbish characters.

  Any other solutions? 

  Best regards,
  Yidan

looks like your serial port baud rate is wrong. At some stage, the
current setting (left by YAMON) gets overwritten by UART setup in 
Linux. Try changing:

go . nfsroot=192.168.149.1:/c/linux/mipseb ip=192.168.149.116

to:

go . nfsroot=192.168.149.1:/c/linux/mipseb ip=192.168.149.116
console=ttyS0,38400

(38400 is the baud rate.. use the value you want)

Just my guess.. worth as much as you paid for it!!

Neal.
