INDIGO2 VICTIM OF FREAK ACCIDENT
Washington - The carcass of an Indigo2 was found stuck to top of the
Washington monument last afternoon. Preliminary investigation showed the
police that the purple object seemed to have gotten stuck in this sticky
situation after having been launched together with a family pack of
Bubba Joe chewing gum from a Medieval Siege Catapult that was on show at
the Natural History Museum. Noone has claimed the machine yet.


HTH. HAND.
