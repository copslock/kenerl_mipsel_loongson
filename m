Not to cause a flame war, but $600 US isn't all that much (I realize
that for somebody who has paid $1000 or less for a used system it can
seem like a lot).

All the disk drive manufacturers that I know of have web pages for
the drive jumper settings.  SGI support doesn't have docs on most of them,
even the current ones, because nobody ever needs to know; they come
setup correctly from the factory.

By the way, with only 5 jumpers to play with on most drives, you
can usually figure it out in less than 30 minutes.

I'm sorry you are so unhappy about it, but it does sound like you
are frustrated over things that seem pretty easy to deal with.
