Howdy!

Ive seen http://info.engr.sgi.com/linux/status.html and
http://bogomips.ingenia.com/ . We are hosting a Linux user's group in
our facility next week and I would love to have an Indy up and running
with it if at all possible. Could someone point me towards an
installation site where I could mirror stuff locally for the
installation? If it will run on an R3k or R4k Indigo (the only machine I
really have as a 100% spare) Ill keep it up to date and running on the
internal net all the time. I have 15-20 Indy's coming in on trade in
about a month (R4400) which I hope to be able to grab one of as well.

Ive looked on ftp://vger.rutgers.edu/pub/linux/MIPS (which was empty),
ftp.fnet.fr (which appeared to be down) and on
ftp://kernel.panic.julia.de/pub/linux/mips/(which appears to have
everything). Before I go and try to mirror this site across our T-1 and
through the SGI firewall, Id really prefer finding somewhere within SGI
that may have this already.

Can anyone point me in the right direction and to a MIPS installation
HOWTO?

Thanks in Advance!
 
                    Eric.
