The trouble is, for some bugs, by the time you've figured out what the
bug belongs to, you're 90% of the way to having fixed it and there's
usually no point to putting it into the bug tracker. At the same time,
using something like "toolchain" is rather vague. It might be nice to
have a list of common trouble areas and then an "Other: ____________"
type field for bugs that aren't obvious.
