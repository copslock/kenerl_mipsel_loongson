Hi folks

I'm trying to track down a SIGSEGV generated by kaffe on the Helio pda.  It 
uses a  Phillips R3912 cpu.

The gdb 6.0 docs say configure as follows:  configure 
--target=mips-idt-ecoff.  I did and mips shows up as an available target.

Unfortunately, when I try to connect to the pda via a USB serial connection, 
I get:

(gdb) set debug remote 2
(gdb) target mips /dev/ttyUSB0
Expected "<IDT>", got "": FAIL
Expected "<IDT>", got "": FAIL
Expected "<IDT>", got "": FAIL
Failed to initialize.
Ending remote MIPS debugging.
You can't do that without a process to debug

Further research shows there is supposed to be a target named r3900.  It 
doesn't show up under my available targets and

(gdb) target r3900 /dev/ttyUSB0

gives and error saying there is no target named r3900.

Can anyone out there give me advice about gdb and mips cross debugging?

Mark
