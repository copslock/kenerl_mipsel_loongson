Over the past month I have been struggling trying to make my compilers
work under RedHat Test-7.0.  I attempted to do the rpmi -i with the
rpm's in the build with not much success.  Seems like the core things
are missing.  If possible I need help with the steps that are needed to
make the compilers work.  I want to be able to compile things like the
kernel, bind, apache, and sendmail.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you in advance.
