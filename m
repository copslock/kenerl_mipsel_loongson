Yes, we understand why non-executable stack is not compatible with the 
FPU emulator.

But is the R6 code already in the lmo or kernel.org repositories?

If not, then the lack of this patch is not a gating issue.  If this 
patch is really needed for R6 support, why not submit the R6 
prerequisite patches first?

If this patch has nothing to do with MIPS R6, then state that.

How can it be just 5 lines of code?  You have to emulate all those 
instructions:

   ADDIUPC
   AUIPC
   ALUIPC
   LDPC
   LWPC
   LWUPC

I think that is all of them.  You can emulate all of those in 5 lines of 
code?

We need to support everything the toolchain could product in the future. 
  I don't think it makes sense to add all this stuff when it is well 
known that it doesn't solve the problem for MIPS R6, especially when the 
justification for the patch is that it is needed for R6.

I understand what your goals are here, I have spend many months working 
towards a non-executable stack (see the patches that moved the signal 
trampolines off the stack).  But I am worried that there are many cases 
that it will not handle.

I'm not saying that the patch doesn't work under your highly constrained 
test conditions, I believe that it does.

I am not familiar with the SOAK test.  Does it really put faulting 
instructions the delay slots of FP branch instructions, catch the 
resulting signal, and then throw an exception from the signal handler?

It can't be true the PC relative support is not needed, why did you add 
the PC relative instructions, if you didn't want to use them in Linux 
userspace?

Really what I was talking about was a wider audience, the people that 
will write tools and code that target userspace.  They will want a 
solution without a bunch of restrictions forced upon them by the 
limitations of the FPU emulator.

Here is my proposal:

1) Add an emulator for all documented MIPS R6 instructions that can 
appear in a linux userspace delay slot.

2) Document as not supported placing COP2 instructions in FP branch 
delay slots.

3) Get rid of this execute-out-of-line code in the FPU emulator all 
together.

4) Enable non-execute stack.

In order to have full MIPS R6 support in the kernel, you will need an 
emulator for a subset of the instructions anyhow.  Going to a full ISA 
emulator will be a little more work, but it shouldn't be too hard.
