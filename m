I intended there to be an introductory email that said:

The following is a patch adding preliminary device-only OTG support for
the Au1200 and Au1250.  It is made largely of code that I inherited that
was never published.  This is the largest patch I have submitted thus
far, and the first one including a new driver.  I welcome comments on
anything in the code, as well as the format and presentation of the
patch.  I will happily rev this to meet the community's standards.
Thanks.

(I'm clearly still getting the hang of git-send-email)
