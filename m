Hello,

I'm using a Cobalt Qube 2 for a long time now, it's under a 2.4.14 
kernel working 24/24 7/7 without any problem (no weird hang, no tulip 
problems, both internal network cards used).

It's appears that the new libc needs at least a 2.4.19 kernel, this is 
breaking all my debian updates. So I'll have to switch.

Do you have any advice about which kernel to use  ?

According to what I read here, 2.4.23 seems not ready and it's not clear 
to me if newest kernels still have problem whith the network/serial bug...

Regards,

Stephane
