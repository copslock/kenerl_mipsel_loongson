There's still a few small kinks.  We still have the traditional mbox
archives on the ftp server but now also on www.linux-mips.org/archives
html archives which are fully searchable.  There are still a few bugs
but certainly that archives is very usable; it's updated every few hours
only may lag a bit behind the mbox archives.
