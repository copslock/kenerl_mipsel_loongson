I won a Linux book ("Linux Bible") at a bookstore,
and I don't even have a home PC.  So I have a
bit of a dilemma, and I see 2 ways out.  Solution (1) is
to buy a PC ...  solution (2) is to give away the
book.

I've elected solution (2), so I was hoping 
someone on this list would be able to use the
book.  If so, I will give the book to the first
person to reply by mail asking for it; please
do not phone.
