-> Stock kernel won't work.  See http://oss.sgi.com/mips/mips-howto.html
-> for how to get the latest MIPS kernel.

Well I don't know how stock it is anymore. Over the last two weeks I made
changes to about 139 files and had to add in another 116. %*O I just
downloaded the 2.4.3 kernel from the MIPS Inc. site so I'll have a look at
it.

I'll double check it. I think it was aliased, or maybe softlinked, but I'm
currently running NT so I'll have to reboot to get back to the Linux side
and see.
