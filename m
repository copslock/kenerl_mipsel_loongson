Yes.

Note that the terminology used in the manuals may be confusing here.
They call KSEG0/1 and - on 64 bit - XKPHYS "unmapped spaces".  But
obviously there is a mapping from virtual to physical addresses.  It's
just that there is no TLB entry being used for these mappings.

It's easier to understand if you see that all memory accesses are going
through the cache, TLB mapped or not.

16K is a silver bullet solution to all cache aliasing problems.  So if
your issue persists with 16K page size, it's not a cache aliasing issue.
Aside there are generally performance gains from the bigger page size.

Yes; it would print "PIPT" if the cache was aliasing-free.

Now that very much sounds like an aliasing issue!

You're welcome.

I'm just wondering the underlying issue might be a generic problem.
