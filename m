Hello

As far as i know there aren't any more recent patches for it, as far as
the 2,6 branch is reffered. I have a patch for 2.4.32, other people too.

You can find the patches at:

http://www.amilda.org/   (my site, we have a little distribution for
ADM5120-based routers)
http://midgle.vlad.org.ua/   (another distribution, but with different goal)

Hope this helps you.

Sergio Aguayo
