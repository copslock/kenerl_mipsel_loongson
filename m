The other day on irc.openprojects.net #mipslinux, someone said that the
initial O2 port was done using the irix header files to glean enough
hardware info to make the needed changes.  How would this process
work?  Could someone post examples of how parts of the header files
indicate how to get something else to boot on the hardware?
