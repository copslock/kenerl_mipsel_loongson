Hi all,

I've just signed on to this list and have procmail working reliably.  I
asked this once before, but I don't think it went out.

I've got an R4400SC-150 Indy and I'm wondering if its supported.  The Web
site and mailing list seem to offer conflicting information.   I was attempting
a net install from an i386 RedHat 5.1 box and it grabs the kernel okay, but
dies trying to mount the root partition with a VFS error. 

Thanks,
Brian Toscano
