     Shouldn't need more margin -- that why those a minimum timings.

    Now that I think again, neither of those is correct. We must treat the 
data as a stream of bytes.

	count = words > 16 ? 16 : words;
	words -= count;
	iowrite16_rep(ptr, data_addr, count);
	ioread(ap->ioaddr.altstatus_addr);

    It's not broken -- using iowrite16() is wrong.

    It's not the first time I'm seeing this driver, so I'm familiar with the 
trick. Altho I didn't realize that this abuses the shared write buffer.

    Actually, these register *always* overlap. That's the way that IDE thing 
works. :-)
    But I'm getting it now -- no way to differ the data read/write from the 
error/feature register read/write in 16-bit mode.

    That's not exactly a good design desicion...

    Not necessarily. Depends on when the DMA interrupt occurs. Although it 
probably predates the IDE interrupt...

    But your probe will abort seeing only one resource. I think this needs to 
be changed.
