Yeah, I'm actually going to be there to talk about SGI/Linux.  And I've
already arranged with the folks in Atlanta to get me a monitor so that I
can bring my little blue fellow down to put SGI/Linux on display.

In other news, I have in my possesion 15 copies of Rough Cuts, on which
disk 3 is the hardhat release we worked on.
