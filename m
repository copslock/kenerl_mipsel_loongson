As for this driver, anyway I should move this calculation to the
transfer function to handle per-transfer speed_hz, so there is no
serious requirement to modify max_speed_hz here.

I agree reporting the actual speed to the protocol driver might be
useful, but I should think a bit more.

These nsecs delays are all comes from spi_bitbang driver I referred
when writing this driver.  As you already found, this controller does
not have dedicated chipselect signals and generic GPIO is used for
them.  As the controller do nothing about CS, the driver should take
care of CS setup/hold/recovery time.

I will move these delays to cs_func() and add some comments.

Oh I had missed these per-transfer parameters.  I will add some
checking for them.

Sure.  I will move it before actual transfer.

Will fix.

Oh it should be a bug.  I will fix by recording last chipselect.

Yes this was a hack...  I will try to make MIPS ioremap() can handle
this special case.

Another hack.  Good to know about the clock framework.  That's what
I wanted.  I will try to implement them for MIPS.

Yes, I'm using GPIO number as chipselect value.  This controller
itself does not have any constraint about chipselect, I wanted to set
num_chipselect as "unlimited".  Though providing max GPIO number or
mapping table might be safe, I think just using chipselect number for
GPIO as is would be simple and enough.  I will do explicitly
initialize num_chipselect as 0 and add a comment for it.


I will send an updated patch in a few days.  Thank you.
