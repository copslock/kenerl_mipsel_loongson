Hi Linuxies,

As much as I admire rms, his amazing life achievements,
and the free software movement he created, let's not accept it
"as is" when he talks in his strong opinionated style in the
name of others.  I happen to know two major FSF contributors
that would love to get SGI hardware and make GNU stuff work
on IRIX _or_ Linux.   Please keep emailing me leads :-)
