IMO, it's more easier with current approach. Updating reference counter
inside uprobe_write_opcode() makes it tightly coupled with instruction
patching. Basically, reference counter gets incremented only when first
consumer gets activated and will get decremented only when last consumer
is going away.

Advantage is, we can get rid of sdt_mm_list patch*, because increment and
decrement are anyway happening in sync. This makes the implementation lot
more simpler. If I do it inside install_breakpoit()/ remove_breakpoint(),
I've to reintroduce sdt_mm_list which makes code more complicated and ugly.

BTW, is there any harm in exporting struct uprobe outside of uprobe.c?

Actually, it's by design. This counter keeps track of current tracers
tracing on a particular SDT marker. So only boolean can't work here.
Also, yes, multiple markers can share the same reference counter.

There are many different ways user can change the reference counter.
Ex, systemtap and bcc both uses uprobe to probe on a marker but reference
counter update logic is different in both of them. Systemtap records all
exec/mmap events and updates the counter when it finds interested process/
vma. bcc directly hooks into process's memory (/proc/pid/mem).

> If yes, why this can't race with __update_ref_ctr() ?

Right. But there is no synchronization mechanism provided by the SDT
infrastructure and this is all userspace so there are chances of race.
At least, this patch still tries to make sure that reference counter
does not go negative. If so, throw a warning and don't update it.

I don't remember the exact reason but seem its unnecessary. Let me try to
recall the reason, otherwise will remove it in the next version.

Hmm, I haven't seen reference counter shared across processes. But as this
is a generic infrastructure, I'll add a check there.

Thanks for the review,
Ravi
