To Anyone who can help me:

I just get an Indy R5000, but the hard disk has been erased, so I 
don't have Irix either.

I have used TurboLinux in a pc-based machine and now I want to use 
Linux in my Indy, but I don't know what download and how install it.

Can anybody help me????

Thanks.

Hector Lara
