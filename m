Hi !

I've got a working debian linux on my Indy, and I fetched the
[kernel-source-2.4.16_2.4.16-1_all.deb] package
but I couldn't recompile it !
There are lots of warning and errors, both for kernel/modules
I began patching (succesfully) ones concerning scsi, but there still remains
keyboard and other part failing to compile..

Do I have to apply some special patch ??
I just D/L [kernel-patch-2.4.16-mips_2.4.16-0.011212.1_all.deb] => is it it
? Is it the best patch, for compiling sources on my Indy ?

Thanks,

Nicolas Sauzede.
