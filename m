Sorry if I am off base, but is linux on SGI MIPS alive? I ask because the
status on the web site is a year old and the mailing list archive is not
working.
I just picked up and Indy with no hardrive, and would like to put linux on
it. I put a new drive in it, but from reading the hardhat FAQ, I need IRIX
to partition the drive. Well I don't have IRIX, is there any other way to
do it? I would love to get this beast running.
