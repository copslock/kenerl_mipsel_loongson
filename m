Hi SGIers,
	There are people from the outside that are interested in the
progress of the Linux/MIPs effort.  So I'm adding them to the list if
they look like reasonable sorts.  For example, a guy from Red Hat, the
company that produces a distribution for DEC Alphas and for Intel,
is now on the list.  I suspect that we might be able to work with them
to get a Linux/MIPs distribution.  Furthermore, givem that Linux/MIPs
will run IRIX elf binaries, we might be able to merge the Freeware and
Linux/MIPs efforts - they have a lot of overlap.  Something to think 
about.
