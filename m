I was thinking that instead of having one pinctrl-ingenic instance 
covering
0x600 of register space, and 6 instances of gpio-ingenic having 0x100 
each,
I could just have 6 instances of pinctrl-ingenic, each one with an 
instance
of gpio-ingenic declared as a sub-node, each handling just 0x100 of 
memory space.

Then I can make pinctrl-ingenic and gpio-ingenic share a regmap (through 
syscon),
which would be a good idea anyway since the two drivers poke to the very 
same
registers (in theory not at the same time, but it's never safe to assume 
things
like this).

Problem is, that in that case the pin functions/groups (and 
ingenic,pull-ups)
would have to be in DTS because we would have 6 instances with different 
pin
groups, and I know you hate that.

Thoughts?
