Does anyone know of a 2.4.x working kernel for IP22?  If so where do I
get the source or the binary?  I am currently using 2.4.3, but it seems
to have a bug, that if you are doing heavy IO operations on a filesystem
other then the root, the machine completely locks up.  

Any help would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks
