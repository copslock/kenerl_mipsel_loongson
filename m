 This year, our best sell is Mini Mist Maker, it utilizes electrical oscillation 
frequencies, via ceramic disc's high frequencies resonance to create natural 
white mist/fog on the surface of water, No heat or chemicals needed, just place 
it into clean water, the mist add humidity to a room and the negative ions generated 
by the unit help to freshen air, if add a few drops of fragrant oil or disinfector 
oil to the water, it will produce an effect similar to an incense burner and 
give you a clean dreaming space, breathe natural fresh air. Matching transformer
