Okay, this fits then.  I wasn't sure, because the verbiage in the BRIDGE docs
kinda-suggests that the 1GB window for 32/64-bit memory space isn't common.
Likely, what they're getting at is the fact the lower 1GB for 32-bit is aliased
in the next 1GB for use by 64-bit PCI devices.  It looks like the remaining 2GB
in memory space is available for DMA, and I'll have to try and wrap my head
around that at later date.

So basically, this bit of code from the proposed pci-bridge.c needs additional
work:

	bc->mem.name = "Bridge MEM";
	bc->mem.start = (NODE_SWIN_BASE(nasid, widget_id) + PCIBR_OFFSET_MEM);
	bc->mem.end = (NODE_SWIN_BASE(nasid, widget_id) + PCIBR_OFFSET_IO - 1);
	bc->mem.flags = IORESOURCE_MEM;

	bc->io.name = "Bridge IO";
	bc->io.start = (NODE_SWIN_BASE(nasid, widget_id) + PCIBR_OFFSET_IO);
	bc->io.end = (NODE_SWIN_BASE(nasid, widget_id) + PCIBR_OFFSET_END - 1);
	bc->io.flags = IORESOURCE_IO;

The values I've been using for PCIBR_OFFSET_MEM and PCIBR_OFFSET_IO are
obviously wrong.  For IP30, they ultimately direct "BRIDGE MEM" to the first
five device slots via small windows, and then "Bridge IO" to the last two
slots.  This is one of those "luck" moments that happened to work on BaseIO,
but is probably why devices in the secondary PCI shoebox are hit-or-miss.

Per your comment further down that I can tell the PCI core about //multiple//
windows, probably what I want to do is hardwire access to the small window
spaces in the main BRIDGE driver, with machine-specific offsets passed via
platform_data.  Small windows, for both IP30 and IP27, are always guaranteed to
be available without any additional magic.  This window range can be used to do
the initial slot probes to query devices for their desired BAR values.

Then, in IP30-specific or IP27-specific code, we add in additional memory
windows as needed.  IP30 would simply pass along the hardwired address ranges
for BRIDGE MEM or BRIDGE IO via both medium and big window addresses.

IP27 is trickier -- we'll need some logic that attempts to use a small window
(16MB) mapping first, but if that is too small, we'll have to setup an entry in
the HUB's IOTTE buffer that maps a specific block of physical memory to
Crosstalk address space.  This is what IP27 calls "big windows", of which there
are seven entries maximum, on 512MB boundaries, per HUB chip.  However, only
six entries are available because one IOTTE is used to handle a known hardware
bug on early HUB revisions, leaving only six left.

As such, the additional window information will go into the machine-specific
BRIDGE glue drivers (ip30-bridge.c or ip27-bridge.c).

Sound sane?

No need to worry about PCIe on this platform.  You're talking about 15+-year
old hardware that was built to last.  I believe SGI only implemented up to PCI
2.1 in the BRIDGE and XBRIDGE ASICs.  It's possible the PIC ASIC might do 2.2
or 3.0.  But I don't have to worry about PIC for a good while, as that's only
found in the IP35-class of hardware (Origin 300/350/3000, Fuel, Tezro, Onyx4,
etc).  We need fully-working IP27 and IP30 first, because much of the working
logic can then be re-purposed for bringing up IP35 hardware.  Especially since
IA64 did a lot of the work already for the Altix systems, which is just IP35
with an IA64 CPU, but I digress...

Not sure what ECAM is, but yes, SGI wired each BRIDGE ASIC for a maximum of 8
PCI devices (or slots).  There can be multiple BRIDGEs in an SGI system,
though, and for several of their XIO add-in boards, you have one PCI device
hardwired into a BRIDGE ASIC, so whatever logic I cook up is going to need to
handle BRIDGE's with one device or eight.  So much for this being easy...

Yeah, PCI-to-PCI bridges are a known-broken item right now.  Since there
appears to only be a single Type 1 config space, if I have a PCI Shoebox with
three PCI-X slots, and I stick three USB 2.0 boards in them, I have to pick
which one can handle PCI-to-PCI bridges, like USB hubs, and program that into
this Type 1 register, right?

I'll have to pass this question to the OpenBSD dev who maintains the xbridge
driver.  He understands this hardware far better than I do, and there might be
a reason why they do it that way.

IOC3 is....special.  You'll never see one of those beind a PCI-to-PCI bridge,
thankfully.  That device is evil enough just sitting exposed on the main PCI
bus.  Just look at the comments in mainline arch/mips/pci/ops-bridge.c for some
rather flavourful language regarding IOC3.  Basically, IOC3:

  - Claims it's a single-function device but is really multi-function.
  - Implements only half of the PCI configuration space.
  - Read/write ops to the unimplemented PCI config registers are undefined.

Living "behind" the IOC3 device is your ethernet, serial ports (RS232 and
RS422), parallel port, keyboard/mouse PS/2 ports, and the RTC chip.  The IA64
people have an IOC3 "metadriver" in drivers/sn/ioc3.c that takes care of
dealing with that monster, and one of the later patches I've yet to send in
moves that driver to drivers/misc/ioc3.c (next to ioc4.c) for use by the SGI
MIPS platforms.  But that is a ways off, as we need working Xtalk code and
working BRIDGE code before the IOC3 metadriver can be worked on.

I do not think that the BRIDGE supports AER, VC, or SR-IOV at all, primarily
due to age of the hardware.  Even if a PCI device that does support those is
plugged into a BRIDGE, I am not 100% certain those features would even be
usable if the BRIDGE doesn't know about them.  Or is this a case of where the
BRIDGE wouldn't care and once it programs the BARs correctly, these features
would be available to the Linux drivers?

Okay, I stumbled across this URL:
http://moi.vonos.net/linux/the-pci-bus/

Which gives a good, plain-english breakdown of BARs and whatnot.

I remember from the OpenBSD xbridge driver, it states that it currently uses
the BAR mappings setup by the ARCS firmware, but the plan is to eventually move
away from those mappings and calculate its own.  I didn't quite get that, but
after reading that site, now I do.  ARCS is writing ~0 to the BARs to query the
device to figure out how much memory each BAR wants, then programs in some
ranges for us.

By tallying up the total requested size of all BAR mappings on a given device,
we can then make a determination on whether we can use a small, medium, or
large window and then program the BAR with the correct address.  Right?

Could also do my own probes (or maybe Linux already does this?), but for the
short-term, using what ARCS has already setup might not be a bad idea to get
things working again.

So for the MIPS case, knowing that ioremap() and friends is not guaranteed to
return a workable virtual address, I need to be careful of what addresses I
program into each BAR.  E.g., given that on IP30, if a physical address starts
with 0x9000000f800xxxxx, it is using medium windows to talk to a device on the
BaseIO BRIDGE (Xtalk widget 0xf).  As such, knowing MIPS' ioremap() returns,
for the R10000 CPU case, the requested address OR'ed with IO_BASE
(0x9000000000000000), I want to tell the PCI core to use 0x0000000f800xxxxx so
that ioremap() will return back 0x9000000f800xxxxx?

And since I can apparently specify multiple window ranges for memory space and
I/O space, I probably want to, as stated earlier, specify all three of IP30's
known window ranges for each BRIDGE so that the Linux PCI core can walk each
resource struct and find a matching window?

If that thinking is correct, then I have some idea of how to set that up and
then see if things start working again on IP30 and then eventually, IP27.

DMA is the tricky one.  OpenBSD's xbridge driver implies that BRIDGE's IOMMU
has a bug of some kind in it that restricts our DMA-able address ranges to 31
bits, or 0x00000000 to 0x7fffffff.  IP27 doesn't seem to be bothered by this in
the current code, and as such, I can use all 8GB of RAM on that platform.

But IP30 has its physical memory offset 512MB, so physical memory maps begin at
0x20000000 and run to 0x9fffffff.  This means someone playing with Linux on an
IP30 platform can only install up to 2GB of RAM right now, if they want the
machine to be stable.  Though, there are other issues going on that imply that
"stable" is a very subjective term...

In either event, how do I teach the Linux PCI core that the BRIDGE itself is
limited to 31bits of DMA-able address space?  There seems to be plenty of
documentation on having an individual PCI device set this up by setting its DMA
mask, but I can't seem to find any wording on how to do this for an entire PCI bus.

Or is this an architecture-specific thing?  MIPS has the dma-coherence.h header
for defining system-specific DMA quirks, but that code seems heavily biased
towards PCI devices, and on IP30 at least, the Impact and Odyssey video cards
are NOT PCI devices at all, instead being native XIO devices that support DMA
operations.

Agreed, however, I think this is actually being done to some extent already.
We're configuring BRIDGE-specific properties and writing some values to BRIDGE
registers and the per-slot registers in bridge_probe() in the generic
pci-bridge.c driver, then, at the very end, calling register_pci_controller(),
which I believe is what kicks off the PCI bus scan.

The IP30 BRIDGE glue code adds a new function hook called "pre_enable" where it
does, in ip30-bridge.c, some additional PCI device tweaking, but this code will
run after the PCI bus scan has happened.  My guess is that I want to reverse
this and have the IP30 glue code twiddle the PCI devices on a given BRIDGE
before the PCI bus scan, right?  That code uses pci_read_config_dword() and
pci_write_config_dword() -- are these functions safe to use if we haven't
already done a PCI bus scan?

Thanks!
