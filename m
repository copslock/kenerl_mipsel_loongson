Hi, Fuxin Zhang
======= 2003-09-16 18:15:00 WROTE=======

>To compile a module on mips,some compiler flags are required. An example:
>  CFLAGS=
>     "-I /usr/local/src/linux-mips/include/asm/gcc -D__KERNEL__ 
>-I/usr/local/src/linux-mips/include
>-Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -Wno-trigraphs -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer 
>-fno-strict-aliasing -fno-common
> -G 0 -mno-abicalls -fno-pic -mcpu=r4600 -mips2 -Wa,--trap -pipe 
>-DMODULE -mlong-calls"
I have tried to change the compiler flags before.And I am not sure the 
exact meaning of the "-mips2".I think it is related to our mips.When I 
compile my mips-linux kernel,I used "-mcpu=sb1 " and our mips is
mips64 , but the kernel we use is linux for mips32, because I know linux 
for mips64 doest not support kernel module yet(It is a trouble to me too). 
One thing confused me is that with the flag "-mips2" or "-mips32", or 
"-mips64", when I compiled my kernel module,it will get the following error  :
______________________________________________________________________________________________
sch_example.c:80: warning: function declaration isn't a prototype

________________________________________________________________________________________________
But when i removed that flags it will be compiled ok, of course it is still can not work ok when i
try to "insmod".:)~
Any advice for me ?

Yes, I have noticed this before and my others simple kernel module can be
compiled  and "insmod" ok. So i think it is the tq_timer or the queue_task
that arose the trouble as you said follow.

I have notice the change of the "struct tq_struct" .
But I am not sure  whether the task queue is the best choice to be used here.
Because I know the evolution of "task queque-->tasklet-->softirq" . It seems 
"task queque" is a obsolete way.Ha~, maybe I should try to learn how to use
tasklet or softirq.
Is it a right think ? What is your advice?  And what should I do ?
As a newbie to the kernle module ,I am so so so confused.
Thank you again. You are an excellent Linux Man.
