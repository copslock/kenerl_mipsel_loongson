Hi,

Just wondering if the SMP support is working at all. Sometimes
there are patches that affect the SMP support.

Got a challenge L with two R4xxx cpu's. Could start working on it
 via a nft root and give some feed back, fixes etc.

Just one question. The terminal is broken and a guy at SGI Denmark 
told me how to create a null modem that worked on the challenge L but 
I have lost the paper. Any one got a clue?

Best regards,

Søren
