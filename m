Hi Jean,

 Could be -- my memory happily still extends back beyond that moment of
time.

 Now this is certainly a valid point.  But the concept of -stable is
recent enough this is only the second or third time I see it mentioned.

 Well, you have spotted one counter-example now who does not hurry enough
for it to spoil his work.  Besides, the time required to put a header
inclusion at the right place in an ordered sequence is the same as for an
insertion at a random position.

 Well, some people do not read user manuals either -- perhaps they have 
missed the annotation too?

 Well, this is the first time I hear it stated by someone else.  Good 
progress, I would say...

 Well, if developers cannot be bothered to produce quality results, then
perhaps they should be doing something else?  There is no obligation to be
a software developer, is it?

 Well, I had a look at this file while writing my changes and this is the 
very thing that is unclear.  The only place the description refers to 
emulation is the I2C_FUNC_SMBUS_EMUL flag and there is nothing said
about any other I2C_FUNC_SMBUS_* flag in the context of emulation.  The 
rest of the file refers to functionality provided by the adapter, which 
can be reasonably assumed to be such provided directly by hardware.

 Having improvements and bug fixes applied to some of the repeated code
sequences only has its cost as well.  If the piece of code is small then
it can go to an inline function and the interface cost is null.  If it is
big, then it can go to a library from which all the interested modules can
import it with no need for an additional module.  Even pieces of code as
small as the Ethernet CRC calculation have been decided worth being put
into a single place even though there is little room for improvement or
breakage there.

 Go chase all the copies of code to support the SCC or the LANCE scattered
throughout our tree and figure out which has the least bugs and/or the
most features if you have any doubts about how to classify code
duplication.

 I am not assuming anything here.  I have only stated that if this
approach to transfers involving a range of commands was useful elsewhere,
then code to do so should not be duplicated throughout all the interested
drivers.  I do not know if there are any other than this -- it is up to
the users and/or maintainers of code in question to determine.

 Will see.  For now here is a new version of the change -- aside taking 
your and other people's comments into account I have improved the logic 
behind required bus adapter's feature determination.

 Everybody interested please give it a try.  It certainly works for me.  
Comments are welcome.  I will submit all the clean-up changes separately,
independently or when the whole set is ready as appropriate, based on
dependencies or the lack of.
