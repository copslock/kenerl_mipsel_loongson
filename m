Hi All,

As you may know, the machine www.linux.sgi.com has had an
interesting history: it was originally Larry McVoy's desktop
which he donated for hosting this service and was never
really officially maintained/supported.  Then it got
replaced by Bob Mende and we used scraped parts, disk etc.
from various places to keep it going as best as we could...

The time has come to host this service on a more reliable
machine, on a faster link, closer to the backbone, that is
actually officially supported by SGI.

So we intend to migrate the old SGI/linux site to oss.sgi.com.

Of course, we will keep the aliases and virtual hosts
working so this should be mostly transparent but as Ralf
just mentioned we ask that people refrain from checking
stuff in until this process is done.  Also: we have had
scores of people who have checked-in stuff long time ago
and never returned so we would like to ask that those who
want to check in new stuff, let Ralf know so he can set
you up for new ssh access.

Any questions comments welcome.

P.S.
And if you see any problems it is _not_ because of any
evil empire or SGI dropping support for Linux :-) but
just because of my ineptitude in doing such things.
I ask for your patience and understanding.  Thanks.

Peace, Ariel
