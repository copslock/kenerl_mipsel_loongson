The work doesn't have to be all done right away.  Still, I think it 
makes sense to separate out the "generic platform" drivers from the 
rest of this patch series.

Some platform drivers require additional storage for things like
pointers to clocks or OTG transceivers.  For example see ehci-mv.c,
which allocates its own ehci_hcd_mv structure along with ehci_hcd.  
Some other drivers even define their own private version of ehci_hcd,
such as ehci-fsl.c.  If you can figure out a good way to expend the
ehci_hcd structure so that it can accomodate the extra fields needed by
all these drivers in a generic way, that would be an excellent start
and well worth merging.  Maybe just adding a "void *platform_data"
field would be enough.

As for special activities during device probing...  Many of these can 
be handled later on, easily enough, by adding appropriate quirk flags.  
We don't have to worry about that part right now.
