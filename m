Cool, I feel much more comfortable now ;)

   Bingo. Larry runs this too. You weird people. Is this a conspiracy? :-)

Nope, not a conspiracy.  Grab a copy of:

caip.rutgers.edu:/pub/davem/penguin.gif

Then run 'xfishtank -p penguin.gif' after hacking endlessly on down
and dirty kernel code for 20 hours straight with no sleep and direct
intraveinus coffee keeping you going, and tell me that isn't the damn
most funniest thing you've ever seen in your life. (note said
description is the state I am in right now, whee... oh yeah, and the
penguin picture was found in Linus's home directory on
linux.cs.helsinki.fi one late night I was hacking on there :)

   For MIPS ABI stuff: try the following web site,

	   http://www.mipsabi.org/
   Especially:
	   http://www.mipsabi.org/Tech/Technical.html

   Tell us what's missing there.

   As for the MIPS programmer's Assembly manual. There is an excellent one
   internally on the Web... I'll try to get you a copy soon.

Noted, I'll check some of that out.  Thanks.

Oh, yummy, heaven on earth.
