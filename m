I'm looking for the solution that will satisfy most ppl. I understand
your arguments against drivers/soc/, but on the other hand I have no
idea where else this driver could go.

Yes, these are drivers for Broadcom flash memories that implement
(more or less directly) MTD API. There is also a new SPI-NOR based
driver I'm trying to upstream (it was already sent, needs accepting
some more spi-nor changes first).

Er, not really. We assume NVRAM content is not bigger than NVRAM_SPACE
(0x8000), but that's all. If NVRAM can be read using MMIO, then it's
always fully available.

There isn't any documented way of reprogramming flash content mapping
into memory.

It's done by the CFE (bootloader). You can find CFE source in some
tarballs published by Asus in their GPL firmware packages. I never
really focused on CFE source, never tried to compiling it or
re-installing.

I guess yes, you could probably use different bootloader and hardcode
all important settings into it (e.g. using DTB).

I guess DT is older than CFE, but Broadcom decided to invent own
solution called NVRAM anyway. This is a bit messy, because it actually
stores hardware details (CPU, RAM, switch) as well as user settings
(e.g. LEDs behavior). I can't say why Broadcom decided to implement it
this way.

We all would love to see Broadcom shipping devices with U-Boot and DT! ;)

That's right, on MIPS we simply detect flash type (drivers/ssb &
driver/bcma) and using that we init NVRAM passing memory offset where
the flash is mapped.

Correct (s/CPE/CFE).
