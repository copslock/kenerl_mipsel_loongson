But you don't have a

union {
        __u32   checksum_v1;
        __u32   checksum_v2;
        __u32   checksum_v3;
        __u32   checksum_v4;
};

so this seems inconsistent. Maybe just call these checksum_v4 /
checksum_1k / checksum_3k?

FWIW, this seems to be only present on secure boot enabled BCM963268
boards or so, so isn't really a v7 checksum, but a signature present
nvram extended checksum. on != 63268 boards with a v7 nvram this won't
exist.

Broadcom doesn't use __packed  either, so one can assume anything with
alignment requirements will be aligned.

char is size 1, it can never be unaligned (as relevant for __packed).
And together they are a multiple of 4, so anything following will be
correctly aligned again.
