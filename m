Hi all,

I am working on a 79s334A MIPS Board. I am using x86 system as host system
for cross compilation. 
I have an application compiled on the host and while trying to execute the
binary on the board it is giving an ERROR.

It is saying "Bus error" and simply coming out.

Can anybody identify what is the error and why it is coming?

Thanks and Regards,
--Rajesh
