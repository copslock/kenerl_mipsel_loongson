That sounds very neat!

Does this tcl script live in the kernel tree? If so would you think it
would make sense for it to also migrate to device-tree.git? I'm not at
all sure if that makes sense but if you think it does please let me know
which paths need top be carried over.

That will then naturally get propagated over to device-tree.git.

I suppose you are now commenting on the Phase II bit where maintenance
of the DTS moves out of linux.git into device-tree.git, rather than
Phase I work, which is creating a split repo which is automatically
synchronised from linux.git but maintenance remains in linux.git, i.e.
what I'm doing here.

AIUI this split/move isn't intended to change the existing policy, which
is already that DTS files are supposed to remain compatible across
kernel versions and that "flag days" are to be avoided. The split is
supposed to make it harder (if not impossible) to accidentally break
that policy.

On the other hand I suppose there is an argument to be made for clearing
up the cruft *before* making the split.

Ultimately I think this will be up to Grant & co.

Yes, once we move onto Phase II I don't expect it will end up being me
that is the DTS maintainer -- I expect the maintenance will remain with
those who take care of it in linux.git today.

My involvement in Phase I is really just to help out with the transition
(ulterior motive: the Xen project would also like to use these DTS
files...) not to perform a "land grab" or take over maintenance etc. I
certainly don't think I am the right person to become the long term
maintainer of device-tree.git!
