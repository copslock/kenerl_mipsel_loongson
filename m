    Yes, I see one case where the distinct port type serves its purpose --
iotype could have been used instead anyway.

    Well, regshift of 2 seems more fitting for the 32-bit registers. This is 
not principal but using 0 regshift don't actually buy anything -- the shift 
will be perfomed anyway.

    Yes. And it's after you have yourself pointed out the compatibility 
issues. :-)

    Now this is up to Russel. :-)

    BTW, I guess for RM9000 it should be also reserved?

    Does RM9000 have UART_BUG_TXEN flag set?  Note that this code will only 
execute in such case.

    No, it's intended as just a method of accessing device registers.

    UPIO_MEM32 doesn't actually cover your case as it corresponds to the UART 
with the
fully 8250-compatible register set, just having 32-bit registers instead of 
the usual
8-bit ones. RM9000 is clearly not fully compatible to 8250 in regard to the 
register
addresses since it has RX/TX regs, FCR and the divisor latch mapped to the 
separate
addresses, just like Alchemy UART. And I stressed that it's the main issue 
with this
UART's compatibility to 8250 in my first followup.

> case, UPIO_AU might be the best choice,

    Alchemy UARTs have *different* address mapping, so UPIO_AU clearly 
*cannot* be used for RM9000 UART.

    Why you've used readl() and writel() then, may I ask? :-)

    Yes.

    A good "just to".

    Why?
