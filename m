	There are tables of the systems under

	   http://ssales.corp.sgi.com/products/html/periodic_table.html

   Unfortunately, these are inside the firewall.

This having been noted, is my account at sgi going to be setup soon so
that perhaps I could telnet in using the firewall and look at the docs
mentioned from an internal machine?

Later,
