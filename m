Same for m68k, and probably other architectures.

I believe the plan is to add future syscalls for all architectures in a
single commit, to keep everything in sync.

Regardless, I'm wondering what to do with the holes marked "room for
arch specific calls".
When is a syscall really arch-specific, and can it be added there, and
when does it turn out (later) that it isn't, breaking the
synchronization again?

The pkey syscalls may be a bad example, as AFAIU they can be implemented
on some architectures, but not on some others.  Still, I had skipped them
when adding new syscalls to m68k.

Perhaps we should get rid of the notion of "arch-specific syscalls", and
reserve a slot everywhere anyway?
