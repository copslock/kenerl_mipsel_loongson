I'm not sure which info you exactly are talking about. I believe one
SoC model always use the same CPU, ChipCommon, embedded wireless and
PCIe + USB controllers. However amount of RAM, type of flash (serial
vs. NAND), size of flash, booting method, NVRAM location, etc. all
depend on vendor's choice. I think CPU speed could also depend on
vendor choice.

Sure, I didn't want to add NVRAM driver into arch/arm/ :)

Can you see any solution for making NVRAM support a standard platform
driver on MIPS and ARM? As I said, on MIPS we need access to the NVRAM
really early, before platform devices/drivers can operate.

Take a look at "arch_init_irq" I described above. It needs access to
the MIPS core (bcma bus contains many cores). To get access to this
core (to know it exists and to get it mapped), I need to scan the bus.

I think on bcm53xx early access to the NVRAM is less important, so
this may be not such a big problem at all.
