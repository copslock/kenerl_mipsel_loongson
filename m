Yes, I agree it's really shortsighted of them, but I don't
see any way around it.

There are English versions for both 2E and 2F.  See page 66
of the Loongson 2F document:

http://dev.lemote.com/files/resource/documents/Loongson/ls2f/Loongson2FUserGuide.pdf

The revision number can distinguish some chip revisions, however there
is no guarantee
that changes to the chip will necessarily be reflected in the PRId
register, or that changes to
the revision number necessarily reflect real chip changes. For this
reason, software should
not rely on the revision number in the PRId register to characterize the chip.

Page 72 of the Loongson 2E document
(http://www.lemote.com/upfiles/godson2e-user-manual-V0.6.pdf) has the
same text.

In both documents, the lower byte is defined as "Revision number",
and its value is 0x02 (for both 2E and 2F).

If you'd rather not assume the docs are correct, I can test if
my Yeeloong (Loongson 2F) has 0x02, but then in case it's
something higher, would you be willing to assume:

  rev <= 0x02  -->  2E
  rev > 0x02  --> 2F

or similar logic?  This seems risky if we take into account
that there's no guarantee from the vendor.
