Thank you all so much for helping me get my linux installed. I now have
debian installed on my Decstation 5000/25 having used Mopd. I wrote down
all the information I would need if i needed to do this again and if you
would like you can send it out to other people who have my same problem.
The directions are at http://www.xwizards.com/MopLinuxDec.html 


Thank you all again,
Justin Pauley
