Hi,

More interest in SGI/Linux around the world.
I was contacted by admins in three sites (Korea, Poland,
and the Czech republic) who started mirroring our stuff.

Links to these sites are on our external Linux site:
	http://www.linux.sgi.com/

in the "software" section.

P.S:
Anyone has a stable precompiled Kernel we can put on linus ?
It seems that someone deleted the old kernel that was there
and now people cannot try the stuff.

Peace, Ariel
