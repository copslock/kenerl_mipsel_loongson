Precedence: bulk

: Even a company the size of DEC couldn't persuade more than a handful of
: companies to port their code to Alpha/NT, and this one-man-and-his-band will
: succeed ?

A couple of counters to that:

	a) he's giving it away under the GPL.  Linux used that approach
	   and has at least 3 million, some say 6 million, seats.  Linus 
	   didn't get all those seats - he was helped.   This guy is 
	   asking for help.  Maybe we, SGI, and the other Unix vendors
	   should contribute a few percent of our engineering staff to
	   all working on this to catch up with u$oft.  Together we stand,
	   divided we fall - cliche but uite apropos at the moment.

	b) did you miss the part about the 8086 interpreter so that you
	   can just run binaries unmodified?  I haven't tried it but I
	   imagine it works.

As a friend at DEC said - "we need to grow the pie, not shrink it.  Linux
grows it.  We all benefit".  I agree.
