Yeah, well I just can't please everybody. V6/V7 didn't have the
system timer or clocksource in devicetree, which was good for
you, but then the driver nearly doubled in size and complexity,
and Thierry rightfully refused it. Now I'm at the point where
I'm trying alternative ways of encoding the information in
devicetree, as suggested by various people, just so that you
accept it. Because I don't see any other option.

Just a way to assign a timer to a clockevent.

Same as above, this is just a way to assign a channel to the=20
clocksource.
