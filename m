 I just asked not to remove from now on -- no implied double meaning and 
thanks for respecting my request. :-)

 Just enough plus the usual LKML everyone is free to ignore if they 
cannot stand the volume.  And I got responses from linux-mips, which means 
my choice was right.

 As mentioned elsewhere I misunderstood the semantics of the flags in the 
API.

 There is the usual second START in between to turn around the direction.  
There is no STOP in the process call either, which is what makes it
different from an ordinary write transaction followed by a read
transaction.

 I am not sure such a limited functionality is worth the hassle of making 
it available to clients in a reasonably clean way.  How common an 
extension of this kind is among SMBus controllers?  I would say if there 
are other controllers providing it (perhaps for a different range of 
transfer lengths) and clients benefitting from it, it might be worth 
adding it for this controller as well.  Otherwise perhaps let's wait till 
somebody complains about the lack of this functionality?

 Well, it seems generic enough we may provide wrappers around loops using
i2c_smbus_read_byte_data() and i2c_smbus_write_byte_data() to perform
transactions involving consecutive values of commands for clients to pick.  
You may be right it may be too trivial to bother though -- I am not sure.  
In any case, as suggested elsewhere, the core does not seem the right
place indeed, but a header file or drivers/i2c/lib/ should be appropriate.

 Of course.
