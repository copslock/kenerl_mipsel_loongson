Right.

No.  This sounds _exactly_ like the PPC driver. What we need to do, and
what I intend to do in 2.5 is make this a bit more generic so thatr any
arch can fill out some infos and say we read like this, we write like
that and that's that.

Yeap.  I wanna do this in 2.5.

The 'rtc' driver in drivers/char does read, write, some ioctls and a
/proc bit.  We can make this a bit more 'generic'
