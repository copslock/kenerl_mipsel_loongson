Does anyone else have problems with netcfg when installed from the hurricane
distribution? I get (from memory) a problem in Tkinter.py claiming that
there's no such module tkinter. tcl, tk and tkinter rpms are installed
though...

Oh and binutils 2.whatever seems to be missing from
/pub/redhat/hurricane/RPMS/mips, Alex?
