Cool - I missed these entirely.  I'll get reading :)

These make sense to me at a high level.  I'll throw in a few initial
comments, but I'll be back for a round-two once I catch up on the rest
of the perf code.

(This structure is a bit different in the new rev of the patch, but
nothing relevant to this specific part of the discussion :)

While I'm willing to live with the tradeoff, using ftrace event
numbers from FTRACE_SYSCALLS means that the filter will be unable to
hook a fair number of syscalls: execve, clone, etc  (all the ptregs
fixup syscalls on x86) and anything that returns int instead of long
(on x86).  Though the last two patches in the initial patch series
provided a proposed clean up for the latter :/

The current revision of the seccomp filter patch can function in a
bitmask-like state when CONFIG_FTRACE is unset or
CONFIG_FTRACE_SYSCALLS is unset.  This also means any platform with
CONFIG_SECCOMP support can start using this right away, but I realize
that is more of a short-term gain rather than a long-term one.

Almost :/  I still need to review the code you've pointed out, but, at
present, the ftrace hooks occur after the seccomp and syscall auditing
hooks.  This means that that code is exposed no matter what in this
model.  To trim the exposed surface to userspace, we really need those
early hooks.  While I can see both hacky and less hacky approaches
around this, it stills strikes me that the seccomp thread flag and
early interception are good to reuse.  One option might be to allow
seccomp to be a secure-syscall event source, but I suspect that lands
more on the hack-y side of the fence :)

Anyway, I'll read up on the other filters and try to understand
exactly how per-task, counting perf events are being handled.

It seems like we'll still end up special casing system calls no matter
what as they are the userland vector into the kernel.  Marking
syscalls active right away sounds roughly equivalent to calling
prctl(PR_SET_SECCOMP, 2).  This could easily be done following the
model of syscall_nr_to_meta() since that enumerates every system call
meta data entry which yields both entry and exit event numbers. Of
course, I'd need to understand how that ties in with the per-task,
counting code.

I haven't looked at the other interface, so I will.  I know about the
existence of the perf_event_open syscall, but that's about it.  Would
it make sense to use the same syscall in a unified-interface world?
Even if the right way, semantically it seems awkward.

Thanks for the concrete feedback! I'll follow up again once I better
understand the code you're citing as well as the existing userland
interface to it.

cheers!
