To detect the channels that will be used as PWM I parse the whole 
devicetree
searching for "pwms" properties; check that the PWM handle is for our 
TCU PWM
driver; then read the PWM number from there.

Of course it's hackish, and it only works for devicetree. I preferred 
the
method with the "timers" property.

I'm all for factorisation, but what I dislike with not depending on
MACH_INGENIC, is that the driver now appears in the menuconfig for
every arch, even if it only applies to one MIPS SoC.
