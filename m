Agreed!  But when it is other people lifting the code...

Hey!!!  Some of that 70s (and 60s!) 1s-complement hardware helped pay
my way through university the first time around!!!  ;-)

Though where it once filled a room it is now on a single small chip.
Go figure...

Yeah, when INT_MIN was confined to a single function, no problem.
But thanks to the RCU flavor consolidation, it has to be spread out a
bit more...  Plus there is now INT_MAX, INT_MAX/2, ...

Couldn't be bothered to look up the earlier part of the thread.  Getting
lazy in my old age.  ;-)
