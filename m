CONFERENCE OVERVIEW
---------------------------------------------------------------------

CISSE 2006 provides a virtual forum for presentation and discussion of the
state-of the-art research on computers, information and systems sciences
and engineering. CISSE 2006 is the second conference of the CISSE series
of
e-conferences. CISSE 2005 was the World's first Engineering/Computing and
Systems Research E-Conference. CISSE 2005 was the first high-caliber
Research Conference in the world to be completely conducted online in
real-time via the internet.

The CISSE 2006 virtual conference will be conducted through the Internet
using web-conferencing tools, made available by the conference. Authors
will be presenting their PowerPoint, audio or video presentations using
web-conferencing tools without the need for travel. Conference sessions
will be broadcast to all the conference participants, where session
participants can interact with the presenter during the presentation and
(or) during the Q&A slot that follows the presentation. This international
conference will be held entirely on-line. The accepted and presented
papers
will be made available after the conference both on a CD and as a book
publication.
CISSE's publisher for the book proceedings is Springer.

Conference participants - authors, presenters and attendees - only need an
internet connection and sound available on their computers in order to be
able to contribute and participate in this international ground-breaking
conference. The on-line structure of this high-quality event will allow
academic professionals and industry participants to contribute work and
attend world-class technical presentations based on rigorously refereed
submissions, live, without the need for investing significant travel funds
or time out of the office.

Potential non-author conference attendees who cannot make the on-line
conference dates are encouraged to register, as the entire joint
conferences will be archived for future viewing.

CISSE 2005 received 255 research paper submissions and the final program
included 140 accepted papers, from more  than 45 countries. The concept
and
format of CISSE 2005 were very exciting and ground-breaking. The
PowerPoint
presentations, final paper manuscripts and time schedule for live
presentations over the web had been available for 3 weeks prior to the
start of the conference for all registrants, so they could choose the
presentations they want to attend and think about questions that they
might
want to ask.
The live audio presentations were also recorded and were part of the
permanent CISSE archive, which also included all power point presentations
and papers.

The CISSE conference audio room provided superb audio even over low speed
internet connections, the ability to display PowerPoint presentations, and
cross-platform compatibility (the conferencing software runs on Windows,
Mac, and any other operating system that supports Java). In addition, the
conferencing system allowed for an unlimited number of participants, which
in turn granted us the opportunity to allow all CISSE participants to
attend all presentations, as opposed to limiting the number of available
seats for each session.
