They need to put an extra eeprom (cents) into their design and program it.

There is a mPCIe module (RAK833) available by RAK wireless that uses a
FT2232 as USB-SPI bridge, not uart. I have one here for experiments. It
is detected as generic FT2232 device on usb. As far as I understood so
far the serdev does only support uart based communication, is there a
chance to get USB-SPI bridged modules also working?

Frank
