Subject: Copying include files from IRIX?

There's a few gfx/newport include files that need to be added to the
kernel; I found this out when trying to get drawbars.c to build.  

I can steal everything directly from the IRIX include files, but I wonder
about copyright issues.

What should I do about this?
