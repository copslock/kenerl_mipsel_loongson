Ah, interesting tidbit. So I guess BCM6362, BCM63268 and BCM63381 also
have BMIPS4355.

AFAIK all BCM63xx chips have a timer peripheral with 4 or 5 timers
running at 50 MHz, used as the HPT when using the BMIPS frequency
scaling.

I guess that is the dtb's job to point out the correct system timer.

According to pwrmngtclk.c,the bcm63xx bmipses might not have a fixed
cp0 counter frequency and might scale with the cpu frequency. This
also includes the BMIPS3300 in 6318. This isn't very clear; the code
for snycing the cp0 count is enabled through a Kconfig symbol, but I
don't see anything selecting it. So dunno.

I don't think they should be there either. And checkpatch does not

I don't see anything wrong in reusing conventions, quite the contrary.

BCM6345/6338/6348 might be streching it a bit, but I think 6358 is
still used in semi-recent devices. At least Broadcom still mentions it
on their website [1]. Surprisingly it also mentions 6338, so I wonder
if these are still produced. Also they seem to have dropped the 6328.

Assuming we add the PRID/REV matching to chipid reg location from
bcm63xx, we can use it at the same time for the width/offset of the
chip name part.

Assuming this is the ejtag thingy, this is expected, as it uses a
BCM63283 (no idea what the difference is to the 63281. Maybe some VoIP
related stuff or so). I also have an actual BCM63281, but I'm too lazy
to find an unused ttl-serial, so I'll just pretend it says 0x632810B0.

That would be interesting, as 6369, 63169 and 63269 actually uses a
...9 chip id. According to broadcom code, same for 6319.

There's also the mess of the 68xx gpon socs: 6818 and 6828 seem to use
the "standard" upper 16 bit of the chipid register, but encode a
variety of variants in their chipid:

        /* Force BCM681x variants to be BCM6816 or BCM6818 correctly) */
        if( (r & 0xfff0) == 0x6810 )
        {
            if ((r == 0x6811) || (r == 0x6815) || (r == 0x6817)) {
                r = 0x6818;
            } else {
                r = 0x6816;
                t = (int) (PERF->RevID & REV_ID_MASK);
                if ((t & 0xf0) == 0xA0)
                {
                    r = 0x6818;
                }
            }
        }

       /* Force 6821 and 6822 to be BCM6828 */
        if ((r == 0x6821) || (r == 0x6822))
            r = 0x6828;

6838 seems to use only a nibble [7:4] for the chip id and the second
one for the variant id [3:0]. WTF. Let's pretend it doesn't exist.
Actually let's pretend bcm68xx does not exist at all for now.

IIRC all the dtb files then also use "vendor,boardname",
"lantiq,falcon"; as the compatible strings.

I can think of three options/variants:

1) Use a generic "brcm,bmips". Tthis is similar to e.g.
"marvell,kirkwood", but probably a bit too generic, and might imply
compatibilty for future chips where there is none.

2) Construct "brcm,bcm%x", where x == chipid. This is what I am
currently doing in [2].

3) Similar to 2), but use of_flat_dt_is_compatible() to find out the
SoC the dtb is written for, then use that as the expected chipid. It's
a bit of a tautology, but code could work something like this:

struct chipid_reg {
       char compatible[128];
       u32 chipid;
       unsigned long reg;
       int shift;
};

struct chipid_reg supported_chips[] = {
       { "brcm,bcm6328", 6328, KSEG1(0x1000000), 16 },
       { "brcm,bcm6358", 6358, 0xfff00000, 16 },
       { "brcm,bcm6368", 6368, KSEG1(0x1000000), 16 },
       { "brcm,bcm63628", 63628, KSEG1(0x1000000), 12 },
};

...

      unsigned long dt_root = of_get_flat_dt_root();

      for (i = 0; i < ARRAY_SIZE(supported_chips); i++) {
           if (of_flat_dt_is_compatible(dt_root,
supported_chips[i].compatible)) {
                  u32 val = __raw_readl((void __iomem *)supported_chips[i].reg);

                  if ((val >> supported_chips[i].shift) !=
supported_chips[i].chipid)
                        panic("unexpected chipid!");

                  return true; /* or setup the board compatible to it
or whatever */
           }
      }

      return false;

This is probably the closest to a "generic" multiplatform kernel, as
it will completely disregard the prid/whatever and just blindly follow
the dtb.

> I can experiment with removing that bus registration entirely to see
> what happens.

I'm rather surprised that it actually registered anything. I would
have expected for the code to be like "ugh, the registered dtb does
not have "brcm,bmips" as one of the compatible strings, so I'll ignore
it and don't register any platform devices".

Still looks wrong. Maybe the device-tree folks could throw in their two cents.

don't fix the irqs to one of the cpus, so I'm fine with having only
one of the cpu blocks documented for now.
