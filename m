This is precisely why I gave up on this project. I could not get any
documentation, no machine access (if you don't already have). In my
opinion, SGI Linux project must address this problem if they want to
attract "outsiders", i.e. people who are currently outside the SGI
user community, but what to contribute to a very interesting (!!)Open
Source project.
