I second that motion!

I have a stack of R4400 Indigo's with XZ graphics floating
around and I'd love to put linux on them!  I even have an
R3000 Indigo with XZ graphics that's sitting idle. That's in
addition to a couple of R4000 Crimson boxes, but we won't
get into that now!

So, the relevant questions are - what's the pain level in
doing this?  What info do we need to lay hands on to get
this to happen?  And, as usual the most important question
is - how can I help make it happen?!?


Be well,

Michael
