Bogomips is down right now for a switch to "cleaner power".  (The lights
in this room are going up and down like a toilet seat at a mixed
party, so I'm going to stick it on a UPS.)

I'll probably also swap out the extra drive for use in the March To
Userland, and for the build of the new kernel.

Any news on www.linux.sgi.com?  I can't resolve _any_ sgi.com domains
right now, so I think there might be a problem on my end.

Mike
