Sorry to abuse the list one more time, but this list is such a
suitable place for this ad that it makes posting to any other
places dull. :)

We have an opening in linux/mips kernel area.  Generally the work
will involve kernel porting, driver development and other
montavista linux related features.  Ask me for more details.

This position is for experienced or senior developers.  And it
is located in Sunnyvale, CA.

Thanks.

Jun
