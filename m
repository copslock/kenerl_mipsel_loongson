User and kernel virtual address spaces don't traditionally overlap, so
you don't get that sort of protection at the moment.

MIPS TLBs do have ASIDs though, and kernel mappings are marked global,
so it could easily reserve an ASID with no mappings, and switch to that
while in kernel mode. It'd have to keep switching between them when
reading/writing userland though, as you can't directly access another
ASID, and I don't think thats a particularly cheap operation, especially
on cores with hardware page table walkers.

EVA (enhanced virtual addressing) is a feature present on recent MIPS
32-bit i-class and p-class cores (and p6600 too which is 64-bit),
intended to make better use of 32-bit virtual address space. It can
actually overlap kernel and virtual address space, requiring special
instructions for accessing userland mappings, however each segment can't
have distinct TLB mappings for kernel and user mode (if kernel and user
view of segment differs, kernel would need to see it unmapped, i.e. a
window into physical memory). As such its generally better to keep the
lowest segment visible to both kernel and user, so that kernel NULL
dereferences can still be caught, which would negate the point of using
it for security. It is possible to make it work with watchpoints to
catch NULL dereferences in lowest 4KB, so kernel can't access any user
address space directly, but thats a bit of a hack really. Also since EVA
is aimed at making better use of 32-bit address space, it doesn't
address 64-bit.

Both are best addressed using ASID switching in my opinion at the
moment.
