Somewhen RMS mentioned that they don't have MIPS machines.  Aside of PCs
their equipment seems to consinst of ancient 68k Sony NeWS machines,
an Amiga, old HP machines and other exotic equipment.  I think they also
have an Alpha.

But all in all they are for shure among the people that will make best
possible use of the hardware.
