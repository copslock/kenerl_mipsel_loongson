If anybody wants it then email me .... unless some kind soul will put it
on the ftp site for me as I noticed there was no public upload dir.

It was built using the kernel source found in
/pub/test/linux-970915.tar.gz, crosscompiled on a x86/linux box, using a
patched binutils-2.8.1 and the gcc found in the rpm within the crossdev/
dir.

It has not undergone extensive testing, but given that there were no
errors during compile, I would assume its as stable as anything else out
there based in this kernel.

Let me know if anybody wants the binary or tarball for the ftp site.
