I'm also quite interested in mips linux - I've got an Indigo 2 R4400SC with 128 Mb RAM sitting under my desk at home doing nothing.  Is this a reasonable platform to run ? I understand that I would have to use a serial console at the moment - are there any plans to support a text console on the Indigo 2 gfx hardware (I don't really care about X). How easy is the install ? 

Any info would be gratefully received

Cheers

Mat
