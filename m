I didn't.  I responded to a message from list archives, and could
not tell how many lists were copied ... "WAY too many", clearly.

No; as Jean also noted, since it makes some explicit calls,
it should test for the functionality of those calls.  It should
not call i2c_transfer() unless the underlying adapter accepts
those calls.

That is, no STOP in between, just a repeated START?  In which
case that's a subset of i2c_smbus_read_i2c_block_data().

Right.  Possibly worth updating i2c-sibyte to be able to perform
those calls through the "smbus i2c_block" calls; but maybe not.
(Those calls aren't true SMBus calls, but many otherwise-SMBus-only
controllers can handle them, hence the i2c_smbus_* prefix.)

See above:  they sound like subsets of the Linux "smbus i2c block"
calls.  (Those calls allow up to 32 bytes, much more than what the
i2c-sibyte hardware allows.)

That's true using both native SMBus calls and the
SMBus "emulated" (by native I2C) implementation of
the i2c_smbus_write_i2c_block_data() interface.


You introduced something entirely different:

(I broke each separate I2C message onto its own line for clarity.)

I was talking in terms of i2c_smbus_write_i2c_block_data()
and i2c_smbus_read_i2c_block_data() ... which m41t80 should
be happy with.  (But i2c-sibyte won't be.)

If that second protocol sequence (many messages) happens to
work for a given chip, it can be done *portably* too using
pure SMBus "write byte" calls:  i2c_smbus_write_byte_data().

And that knowledge is very chip-specific, so it's IMO more
appropriate to keep it out of infrastructure like i2c-core.

I can't quite see the point though.  Any driver can write a loop
that calls i2c_smbus_write_byte_data(), if that's an alternative
way to achieve the task on that chip.

It can be rather annoying to try getting some I2C drivers to cope
with a variety of broken I2C adapters.  But that's exactly why
there's a way to ask adapters what they can do.  If they can't
execute the I2C_FUNC_SMBUS_I2C_BLOCK protocols, then M41T80 code
must provide less efficient substitutes ... like looping over
byte-at-a-time calls, and coping with various time roll-over cases
that such substitutes will surface.
