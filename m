Sorry about that.  It's an external set of patches I've been maintaining for
the last decade (I'm not the original author).  Being that I do this for a
hobby, sometimes I get waylaid by other priorities.  I've spent some time
re-organizing my patch collection lately so that I can start sending these
things in.  This series and an earlier one to the Linux/MIPS list are the
beginnings of that, as time permits.  However, I've got a ways to go before
getting to the IP30 patches.  E.g., IP27 comes before IP30, so that's where my
focus has been lately.

I've put an 4.10-rc7 tree with all patches applied here (including the IOC3,
IP27, and IP30 patches):
http://dev.gentoo.org/~kumba/mips/ip30/linux-4.10_rc7-20170208.ip30/

The patchset itself, if interested:
http://dev.gentoo.org/~kumba/mips/ip30/mips-patches-4.10.0/

You can find the IP30 code in:
  arch/mips/sgi-ip30/*
  arch/mips/include/asm/mach-ip30/*

IP27's code is in these folders:
  arch/mips/sgi-ip27/*
  arch/mips/include/asm/mach-ip27/*
  arch/mips/include/asm/sn/*

PCI code:
  arch/mips/pci/pci-bridge.c
  arch/mips/pci/ops-bridge.c
  arch/mips/include/asm/pci/bridge.h

Actually, that's not wrong.  It took me a long time to figure this out, too,
but once I stumbled upon the BRIDGE ASIC specification on an anonymous FTP
site, via Google, by complete accident (hint), it finally made sense.

BRIDGE is what SGI calls the chip that interfaces the Crosstalk (Xtalk) bus to
a PCI bus.  Most known "XIO" (Xtalk I/O) boards contain a BRIDGE chip under a
heatsink at the edge of the board, next to a "compression connector".  Octane
can hold up to four XIO boards, with a fifth slot dedicated to an optional "PCI
Shoebox" (literally a metal box that can hold up to three PCI or PCI-X cards).
One exception to this are the two graphics boards, Impact/MGRAS and
Odyssey/VPro, which are "pure" XIO devices, as far as anyone's figured out.

Each BRIDGE chip can address up to eight different PCI devices.

Crosstalk on IP30 is managed by the Crossbow (XBOW) ASIC.  It implements a
crossbar switch that's not totally unlike a networking switch.  A single XBOW
supports up to 16 XIO widgets, numbered 0x0 to 0xf.  Widgets 0x1 to 0x7 are for
internal use or unused.  XBOW itself is widget 0x0.  HEART, Octane's system
controller, is widget 0x8.  The four standard XIO slots are numbered (I think)
as 0x9 to 0xc.  I think widget 0xe is unused.

The system board has a BRIDGE chip on it to provide the "BaseIO" devices, such
as two SCSI (QL1040B), IOC3 Ethernet, KB/Mouse, Serial/Parallel, Audio, and an
RTC.  This BaseIO BRIDGE is widget 0xf, which is what you're seeing with the
first set of addresses starting with 0x1fxxx.  The second BRIDGE that you're
seeing is the PCI Shoebox I have installed.  It's widget 0xd, and has addresses
starting with 0x1dxxx (second nibble from left is the widget), with three
random PCI cards I found in a storage bin plugged into it.  The Xtalk scan
happens in reverse order, starting at widget 0xf down to 0x0.

Both 0x1fxxx and 0x1dxxx addresses are "small window" addresses.  The HEART
system controller gives you three "windows" into Xtalk space, which uses 48-bit
addressing:

0x0000_1000_0000 - 0x0000_1fff_ffff - Small windows, x16 @ 16MB each
0x0008_0000_0000 - 0x000f_ffff_ffff - Medium windows, x16 @ 2GB each
0x0010_0000_0000 - 0x00ff_ffff_ffff - Big windows, x15 @ 64GB each

So a device on widget 0xf mapped into a small window at 0x0000_1fxx_xxxx could
also be referred to by a big window at address 0x00f0_8xxx_xxxx.  The only
difference is the big window gives you a larger address space to play around
with.  Medium windows are not currently used on the IP30 platform in Linux.
Widget 0x0 (XBOW) is only accessible via small or medium windows.

As such, this layout in /proc/iomem is oddly correct:

My bug is probably that I do the initial BRIDGE scan with small windows in the
main BRIDGE driver (arch/mips/pci/pci-bridge.c), and then IP30's BRIDGE glue
driver (arch/mips/sgi-ip30/ip30-bridge.c) is switching to big windows to probe
each device.  So, yes, different address ranges, but still looking at the same
device.  I'll look into fixing that.  It's partially tied to how I was kludging
the IP27 to also start doing PCI correctly within its own BRIDGE glue driver
(ip27-bridge.c), but I just learned over the weekend that there's missing
functionality I have to port over from old 2.5.x-era IA64 code.  In IP30, big
windows are available by default, but on IP27, what it calls "big windows" need
to go through some kind of translation table, and I'm trying to figure out how
to set that up.

There's also an issue with DMA on BRIDGE on IP30 that limits the system's
memory to 2GB to avoid kernel panics.  OpenBSD's figured it out -- BRIDGE's
IOMMU is busted so it can only do 31-bit DMA max.  I just haven't figured out
how to set that limit in Linux for the entire BRIDGE, not just for individual
devices.

Hmm, from the PCI device's point of view, 0x00200000-0x00200fff would be
correct.  The same address beginning with 0x1fxxx is the Crosstalk view of the
device.  Odds are likely I am not masking something off somewhere, but somehow,
it all still finds a way to work.


> I don't know why we didn't assign space to 0000:00:03.0 BAR 1.

The PCI device sitting at 0000:00:03.0 is the "RAD Audio" chip.  There's an
issue with the driver that I keep forgetting to try and fix, so I've left it
out of my recent kernel builds.  That's probably why no space is being assigned
to it.

USB is...interesting on this platform.  Some USB devices will work, but not
many have been tested.  If my memory recalls, I think UHCI was known to play
nice, but OHCI had issues -- might be the other way around.  EHCI is dependent
on what you plug in and the position of several planets in the sky.  xHCI has
endianess issues with one card that I tried.  It's hard to find PCI or PCI-X
xHCI cards, though.  Most everything now is PCIe.  And due to chassis space
restrictions, using PCIe-to-PCI-X adapters is a no-go.

PCI-to-PCI bridges and USB hubs are totally busted, because BRIDGE's PCI Type 1
configuration space isn't very well understood.  The BRIDGE Specification I
think finally cleared that up, but I have not tried to learn how to actually
set the space up and find a spare USB Hub to play with.

All-in-all, the entire machine is as much a work of art in its inner workings
as how it looks on the outside.  As with all art, it's up to the eye of the
beholder on whether that's a good thing or not </smirk>
