Yes for that reason, I still have retained the HAVE_PWM, once that is
also aligned with pwm core, HAVE_PWM will be totally removed.
I am in the process of doing the same in this series of patch, but was
blocked by mips jz4740 pwm driver.
Will do that very soon in near future.

That's the exact reason for me to come up with this core driver, which has
the minimal part and the one that are common in all pwm drivers.
Not only common most if not all pwm drivers just make use of only these
functions.
Moreover I have aligned all existing pwm driver in my patch 4/7 :-)

Can this be taken after this patch is merged?
