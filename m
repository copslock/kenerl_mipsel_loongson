While MIPS Technologies Inc owns the microprocessor IP of the
old MIPS Computer Systems, as well as much that was developed
while MIPS was part of SGI, it is less than obvious what rights or
responsibilites the new MIPS Technologies has with respect to the
computer systems part of the pre-SGI MIPS business.  It is quite
possible that all that stuff stayed with SGI when MIPS Technologies
spun out.  I will forward the message to our legal people and see
what they have to say.
