Redhat supports MIPS as an embedded target; the only port of their
standard distro they ever publshed was Hardhat Linux aka Rough Cuts
which was a four CD collection of ports of Redhat to various architectures.

(The name Hardhat has been recycled later on by Montavista for their
embedded product which is totally unrelated.)
