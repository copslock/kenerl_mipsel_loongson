That definitely isn't a problem (though it looks like you've probably  
figured that out).  The original user (gianfar) has a similar setup,  
where all 2-4 NICs use TSEC0's MII interface to control the PHYs.  It  
was actually one of the reasons for writing it in the first place--to  
more cleanly share that interface between several different device  
instances.

The PHY layer does handle multiplexed interrupts (I've got boards  
with 4 PHYs sharing the same IRQ).  While I'm not sure returning  
IRQ_HANDLED is the perfect implementation, I'm not sure there are any  
options.  I've worked pretty hard to ensure that PHY transactions  
don't occur in interrupt context so that it's possible to implement a  
driver that has an interrupt signal the end of a transaction.  As  
such, reading the PHY interrupt status cannot happen in the interrupt  
handler, which means the interrupt handler doesn't have the ability  
to determine whether any particular invocation is handling the actual  
cause of the interrupt.

 From what I've seen of the interrupt code, this is only an issue if  
a spurious interrupt starts troubling the same line the PHY is  
using.  Does anyone disagree, or have some better suggestion for how  
to handle this?
