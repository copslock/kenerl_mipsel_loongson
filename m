I'm glad to hear that.

The entire patchset has already been checked by checkpatch.pl, and all
generated warnings have been corrected before submission. So I don't think
the script can help me improving the style beyond this point. Thanks for
pointing out all the additional style issues.

Sure, I will remove these asterisks banners.

In fact I learned to use these asterisks from other kernel drivers to
separate logical sections... and as a said, checkpatch.pl does not generate
a warning about it, so I suspect that, historically, a clear policy about
asterisks banners was never enforced. After finish working on these patches,
perhaps it would a good time to patch checkpatch.pl and add a check for it?

I'll reword my misleading commit message about using regmap.

Let me clarify it - nothing prevents the use of regmap. I originally thought
it would be a good idea since the manual locking can be eliminated.

But later I realized it would mean more changes. In particular, not only pm.c
needs to be a new subdriver, the shutdown code in ml2f_reboot() also calls
ec_write(), and it needs to be converted to a subdriver in drivers/power/reset/
too. Yes, it would be good to refactor these code and move them to a more
suitable place, but currently, the primary goal is to add platform drivers,
not to touch functions I've just fixed and possibly introduce new regressions...

As you've seen, there is a TODO item in [PATCH 6/7] in this series, it says the
CS5536 code also needs some major refactoring: the GPIO needs to be changed,
the clocksource driver needs to be merged with the clockevent driver under
drivers/clocksource, etc. I think we can, as well, save the pm.c/reset.c for
later. Currently, I think it's better to focus on the platform drivers first.

If you still have objections on it, please let me know.

Yes.

No problem.

Thanks for your review, I'll correct all the issues above and send v3 today,
if there's no addition problem in v3, I will start sending the actual platform
drivers (battery/hwmon/etc) for the next round of review.

P.S: This time, I hope Lee Jones, as the MFD subsystem maintainer, has
received my mail and my patch, including this one. Unfortunately, all signs
indicated he hasn't received it. Jones, if you have received this mail but
currently too busy to review, please reply to confirm, thanks!

Sincerely yours,

Tom Li
