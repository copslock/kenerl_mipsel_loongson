			    Linux-Kongress 2002
			    -------------------

			     Call for Workshops

As in the last two years the German Unix User Group (GUUG) with the support
of the German Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) is planning to hold
five 3-day workshops from Sunday, September 1, to Wednesday, September 4 just
before the Linux-Kongress. The workshops will give Open Source developers
from around the world the chance to meet in person and work on their
projects. All Open Source projects are encouraged to apply for sponsorship.
All expenses, including travel, accommodation and conference fees for the
Linux-Kongress will be paid for participating projects.

This is a unique chance for people who have been working together over the
Internet but never seen each other to meet face-to-face and give their
common project a push. Maybe you can use this workshop to finally get the
1.0 version done, or you need to come together to redesign your API, or
maybe you just want to write some code non-stop for a few days.

Workshops will take place at the "Kloster Walberberg", a former medieval
castle and now a monastery and conference hotel set in a beautiful park.
Everything, food, drinks, Internet connection will be provided for, so you
can really concentrate on the job. Meeting rooms will be open 24h a day for
your hacking pleasure.

Please see the FAQ at http://www.linux-kongress.org/2002/workshops/faq.html
for all the details and information about how to apply.

Please make sure to apply soon as the planning time is quite short.

If you have any questions don't hesitate to contact Jochen Topf at
jochen.topf@guug.de.
