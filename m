Except that in '94 the MIPS port was started without any help from SGI.
About the most friendly cites from various SGI representants I was dealing
with at that time was ``What is Linux?''.  The SGI/Linux world started
for real in May '96 when DaveM started at SGI porting my MIPS kernel to
the Indy.  Similar I remember comments in the HylaFax package I downloaded
from one of SGI's ftp servers after mid '95 a file which clearly said that
the author Sam Leffler would not be supported by SGI to do HylaFax.

Times have changed since then ...
