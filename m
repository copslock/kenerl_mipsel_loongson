Hi Paul,

Thank you for your detail explanation. There are few observations below.

So I am just a novice in this, but in my case the bootloader(Uboot) passes
the address in kseg0(e.g 0x9f8a6000), but if I understand correctly
this is just cached access to location 0x1f8a6000.

I am a little bit confused here. so the initrd_start has to have a
virtual address(in kseg0) inside the function init_initrd. Meaning that
when the bootloader passes the arguments to linux through a command line,
then initrd_start has to be already a virtual address? Because I
couldn't see a place where it converts the initrd_start. But when the
bootloader pass the arguments through DT it has to be physical address?

Yes, I have done few tests and it seems to work fine, but I need to
understand it better.
