The linux-mips.org server machine was lately suffering from a number of
issues, including resource problems.  Imgtec / PRL thankfully stepped in
sponsoring a beefy new server machine that's not going to break sweat
under the the workload.

The previous machine was hosted in Budapest, Hungary for a number of
years on Imre Kaloz' openwrt.org server.  The new machine is now hosted
in Falkenstein near Regensburg in Germany.

One notable change is that the new server system now supports IPv6 for all
services.  Please report any problems you may be experiencing.

While the server itself appears to be stable the mailer daemons isn't
always.  Similarly the issues linux-mips.org was experiencing have
corrupted files that were active around the time and among others those
often were temp files or mail folders which may have resulted in the
loss of some email.

Last, not least a big thanks to Imre!

Cheers,

  Ralf
