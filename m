I'll change the messages to indicate the relocation type.

The GNU tools as an extension over the MIPS ABI allows an arbitrary number of
R_MIPS_HI16 relocations to be followed by a R_MIPS_LO16 symbol.  All
relocations of this sequence must use the same symbol, of course.  This is
a very old extension; I think it predates the Linux/MIPS port.
