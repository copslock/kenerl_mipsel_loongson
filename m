I haven't found signs of it in the archives, but is anyone aware of any 
efforts to fold in Broadcom's support for their 4702 processor, as used in 
Wireless gateways such as the Linksys WRT54G? Source code for their kernel 
port can be found here:

  http://www.linksys.com/support/gpl.asp

Would someone from Broadcom prefer to provide the patches?
