Thanks to Bill for answering the documentation part.
Just to add something on the Xsgi part.

Miguel got Xsgi to a point where it was starting without being
very useful (e.g. no functioning mouse) and went to work on much
more important stuff (GNOME) where he made a much bigger impact on
the future of Linux as a whole.  Miguel did an amazing job
considering that he practically reverse engineered everything.

So the short answer is: No. We don't have X on Indy/Linux yet.
