Does anyone have any ideas about SGI-Linux on a Challenge S? As I
understand it a Challenge S is basically an Indy without video and an
extra SCSI controller. Plus, costomers with them aren't concerned
about video or getting X to run & therefore SGI-Linux would be
considered 'done' on them a bit sooner than the full Indy version. 

Is Linux run much on server-only systems?
