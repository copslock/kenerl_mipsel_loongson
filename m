..I'm not sure this list is for discussions of specs or OS/arch 
evangelism (from either side). I like this list because it contains 
useful information about the group efforts with Linux on MIPS hardware, 
and not a lot of crap. I'm a reader, not a contributor, so pardon this 
mail, but as Alex says, can we please stick to Linux? 

My mailbox and I thank you.

Kev
