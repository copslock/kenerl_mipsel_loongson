Yes, I can easily understand what you mean, because this point was ever
considered while writing this patch series. We pass the element list as
opposed to a list_head for the head of the element list because we simply
want to link the elements into pci_bus->resources in pci_create_bus(). This
can be done by a single line:
    list_add_tail(&b->resources, &bus_res->list);

In addition, if we need to do list_for_each_entry() on the list, our target
should always be pci_bus->resources rather than the pci_bus_resource list
which is passed into pci_create_bus() to be part (the meat) of
pci_bus->resources.
