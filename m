Not or improperly flush the I-cache will result in stale instructions
getting executed.  An IBE error otoh is the result of a bus error being
signalled for the CPU's attempt to load instructions from memory.  With
the exception of a few special cases I-cache flushing doesn't happen
when eecuting kernel code, but only for userland and it's also somewhat
unlikely for improper I-cache flushing to result in an IBE error.

A huge problem tracking down the cause of a bus error is that they're
getting signalled by an external agent that is they are not generated by
the CPU itself and there may be a significant delay until the CPU
actually takes the exception.  In my experience the EPC is practically
always worthless in tracking down the cause of the bus error.  Details
depend on circumstances, as usual.
