   Did you know that the article is online?  You can get it through
   the www.sjmercury.com home page.  I found it by clicking on
   "Finland" on the front page.

I realize this, my desire was to have the article hard copy.

   If you want, I'll forward the text to you (presuming you have no or
   bad WWW access).

No need, as I posted later in the evening yesterday, someone has
already sent the article, hardcopy, to me.

Later,
David S. Miller
