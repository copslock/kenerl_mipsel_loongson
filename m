Hello all.

Is anything much happening on this list? I haven't seen any activity for
quite a while? A few real questions too...

Does this port target the R4000 and up, or is it meant to run on R3000s as
well? Also, can anyone point me at the 'canonical reference' for the MIPS
processors? Do MIPS publish programmers reference manuals, or do I have to
hassle their 'technology partners' ie LSI, IDT etc.

Thanks in advance!

Regards
M.Beach
