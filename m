hello,linux-mips
    I have barely finished porting 2.4 kernel to Algorithmics P6032 board.Now I want
to make it more stable and run faster,is there any well-known test or benchmark tools used
by mips kernel group? There are too many benchmark around,I don't know which is better suit
for kernel test. I heard that linus use lmbench?
    Thanks in advance.
Regards
